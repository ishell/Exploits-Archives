Summary
======

A remote "Directory Traversal" and "Remote Execution" vulnerability 
exist in Barracuda Spam Firewall appliance from Barracuda Networks 
(barracudanetworks.com). In the script "/cgi-bin/img.pl", used to show 
graph, the value of the "f" (filename) parameters is not sanitized.

No authentification is required to exploit this remote vulnerability

Other vulnerabilies exist in the advanced utilities section but admin 
privilege is needed.
Affected product

    * Tested on Barracuda Spam Firewall firmware v.3.1.16 / v.3.1.17

Note: on the spyware edition img.pl is present but not executable
Note: on firmware 3.3.* the img.pl is img.cgi and they fixed the 
vulnerability

Impact
=====
    * Arbitrary file reading (as uid of the webserver)
    * Arbitrary file execution (as uid of the webserver)
    * Full reading of the system configuration
    * Audit of the Barracuda Spam firewall

Description
========
Vulnerability #1
---------------------------

As see below the img.pl script try to unlink the file after the reading. 
The webserver user (nobody) should not have a lot of delete permission 
but you have been warned.

In /cgi-bin/img.pl scripts

my $file_img="/tmp/".CGI::param('f');
open (IMG, $file_img) or die "Could not open image because: $!\n";
...
unlink ($file_img);

The "magic" perl open function can also be used to execute commands. If 
the string finish by | the script will execute the command and pipe the 
output to the IMG file descriptor.

file retreivial :
  f=../etc/passwd

remote execution :
  f=../bin/ls|

This vulnerability can be used to extract the admin password (see proof 
of concept)

Vulnerability #2
---------------------------

In the utility section, it's possible to call some process to 
troubleshoot the Barracuda. In the command list we can use Dig and 
Tcpdump ( /cgi-bin/dig_device.cgi and /cgi-bin/tcpdump_device.cgi). The 
input string is validate with a list of valid char but both dig and 
tcpdump allow filesystem operation with standard parameters.

Dig :

   The -f option makes dig  operate in batch mode by  reading  a  list  of
   lookup  requests to process from the file filename.

Tcpdump :

   -r     Read  packets  from file (which was created with the -w option).
              Standard input is used if file is ``-''.
   -w     Write  the  raw packets to file rather than parsing and printing
              them out.  They can later be printed with the -r option.   
Stan-
              dard output is used if file is ``-''.

As the use of some character is prohibited, we can only interact with 
the current directory.

Using -f <some_file_in_the_cgi-bin-directory> in the dig edit box allow 
the partial reading of source code. (grep DiG to reconstruct the code)

Using -r in tcpdump edit box allow only a reading of a valid pcap file 
but we can know if a file exist.

Using -w in tcpdump edit box should overwrite file in the cgi-bin 
directory. (not tested)

Proof of concept
===========

http://<BarracudaHost>:8000/cgi-bin/img.pl?f=../home/emailswitch/code/config/current.conf

    * The config is in /home/emailswitch/code/config/current.conf
    * The config key for the password is system_password
    * The password is in clear text (!!)
    * The IP ACL for admin authentification is the config key : 
httpd_acl_ip_admin_address/httpd_acl_ip_admin_netmask
    * it's possible to desactivate for ~5 minutes the IP ACL (hint : 
look for the shell using by the user sa)
