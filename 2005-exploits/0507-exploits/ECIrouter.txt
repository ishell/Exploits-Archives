Title:	ECI router verification bypass and DoS
Date:	24/07/2005
Impact:	Log in verification bypass
Vendors Status: Not contacted (they were mean to me)

Overview:

The B-FOCuS Router 312+ provides users with a reliable and secured
ADSL2+ connection to the Internet. The 312+ has a single Ethernet port
10/100 and can support either a single computer or multiple computers
sharing a single ADSL2+ line when connecting to a switch. The router's
internal stateful inspection firewall protects the user's PC from
hackers and unwelcome intrusions.
(Tested on B-FOCuS Router 312+ presumably works on all eci routers\products)

Vulnerability:

By default the eci router has a management interface available via http
The interface is protected by a log in screen
This screen can be easily bypassed by accessing the firmwarecfg page
in the unprotected cgi-bin directory
the page provides a way of downloading the routers current settings
including connection passwords and management passowrds
in plaintext
also this page provides a means to reset the modem thus executing a
denial a service attack by making the modem reset constantly
furthermore the page provides facilities to upload new firmware

Affected Version:

All ECI routers
Tested on ECI B-FOCuS Router 312+

PoC:
