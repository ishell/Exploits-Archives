Desc: XSS in CartWIZ
Risk: Medium (Cookie stealing)


store/viewCart.asp?message=%3Cplaintext%3E

allows anyone to retrieve cookie and take control over the account.
I noticed there are also some unchecked input when a user log in into his account and change his own personal data.
This could lead to a permanent xss hole much more dangerous than the above.
