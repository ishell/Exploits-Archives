I. BACKGROUND

PHP iCalendar is a php calendar, more information is available at the
vendor site.

II. DESCRIPTION

PHP iCalendar is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting cause of a wrong
input validation in index.php and will include an arbitrary file
ending with .php.

The vulnerable code is:

> config.inc.php

$printview_default = 'no';

> index.php

if (isset($_COOKIE['phpicalendar'])) {
 $phpicalendar = unserialize(stripslashes($_COOKIE['phpicalendar']));
 $default_view = $phpicalendar['cookie_view'];
}

if ($printview_default == 'yes') {
 $printview = $default_view;
 $default_view = "print.php";
} else {
 $default_view = "$default_view".".php";
}

include($default_view);

As you can see there is no input validation at all.

the right serialized array inside.
