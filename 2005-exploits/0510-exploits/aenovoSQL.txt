About Aenovo
--------------------
   aeNovo is a collection of sophisticated web pages 

that allows you to have a website that's as big and

as elaborate as you make it. Once your aeNovo 

files are moved to your web space you can add, delete

and amend pages, images and all manner of files

 all THROUGH THE BROWSER.

Discussion :
----------------
  Several scripts do not properly validate user-supplied

input. A remote user can create specially crafted

parameter values that will execute SQL commands on the

underlying database.Also it is possible to Inject Html scripts

in vulnerable page.

  One the most Important rules in Application security is 

confidentiality  of stored passwords.To achive this goal 

Applications ( Including web apps) encrypt passwords and

store crypted hashes.This application suffer from Clear Text

Password Storage.
 
   As we know and tested all versions of Aenovo , Aenovoshop   

and aeNovoWYSI are vulnerable.
