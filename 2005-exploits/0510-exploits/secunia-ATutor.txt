4) Description of Vulnerabilities

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in ATutor, which 
can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting 
attacks, disclose sensitive information, and compromise a vulnerable 
system.

1) Input passed to the "addslashes", "asc", and "desc" parameters in 
"include/html/forum.inc.php" isn't properly verified, before it is 
used to create a function call. This can be exploited to call an 
arbitrary PHP function with an arbitrary parameter (e.g. execute 
arbitrary shell commands with the "exec" function).

Examples:
http://[host]/include/html/forum.inc.php?
addslashes=[function]&asc=[parameter]
http://[host]/include/html/forum.inc.php?
addslashes=[function]&desc=[parameter]

Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

2) Input passed to the "section" parameter in "body_header.inc.php" 
and "print.php" isn't properly verified, before it is used to include 
files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local 
resources.

Examples:
http://[host]/documentation/common/body_header.inc.php?
section=[file]%00
http://[host]/documentation/common/print.php?section=[file]%00

Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled 
and that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.

3) Input passed to the "_base_href" parameter in 
"admin/translate.php", the "_base_path" parameter in 
"include/html/editor_tabs/news.inc.php", and the "p" parameter in 
"documentation/add_note.php" isn't properly sanitised before being  
returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary 
HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an 
affected site.

The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 1.5.1-pl1. Other 
versions may also be affected.

======================================================================
