3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in various HAURI
anti-virus products, which can be exploited by malicious people to
write files to arbitrary directories.

The vulnerability is caused due to unsafe extraction of compressed
archives (e.g. ACE, ARJ, CAB, LZH, RAR, TAR and ZIP) into a temporary
directory before scanning. This can be exploited to write files into
arbitrary directories when scanning a malicious archive containing 
files that have "/../" or "../../" directory sequences in their 
filenames.

Successful exploitation allows writing of files to arbitrary
directories, which can potentially lead to code execution (e.g. by
overwriting certain startup files), but requires that compressed file
scanning is enabled.

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Apply patches.

ViRobot Linux Server 2.0:

ViRobot Expert 4.0 / ViRobot Advanced Server / LiveCall:
Updated version available via online update is still vulnerable when 
scanning certain archive types.

Disable compressed file scanning and scan files only after they have
been confirmed not to contain directory traversal sequences in their
filenames and correctly extracted.
