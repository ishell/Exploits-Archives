3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in SqWebMail, which
can be exploited by malicious people to conduct script insertion
attacks.

The vulnerability is caused due to SqWebMail failing to properly
sanitise HTML emails. This can be exploited to include arbitrary
script code in HTML emails, which will be executed in context of the
SqWebMail server, as soon as the user views a received email.

Example:
<img src="cid:>" onError="alert(document.domain);">

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary script code
and makes it possible for a malicious person to perform the same
actions as the user of the webmail account (e.g. sending or viewing
emails).

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

The vendor has issued an updated version of SqWebMail, which fixes
this vulnerability.
