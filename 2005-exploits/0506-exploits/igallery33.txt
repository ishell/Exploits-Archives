Problem 1:

The i-Gallery uses no protection to avoid the directory traversal bug.
The problem happens when the attacker uses the classic pattern "/../" 
that
allows him to see and download any file in the remote system knowing the
path.By use of preview feature of the i-Gallery it`s possible to get 
list
of directory files ( not folders ) and attempt to download them .so not
like most of directory traversal attacks , due to the nature of i-
gallery
you only need to be aware of correct directory path . file name will be
handleded by i-gallery in a nice interface :>

Attack is possible on almost all asp files to get files , but my favor 
browse interface is the "folderview.asp" file .

Google Scanner :

inurl:"/gallery/folderview.asp?folder="


sample exploit :

http://<host>/gallery/folderview.asp?
folder=Sport+Champions/../../../../../../../../winnt/repair

you`ll probebly go for "SAM" but I should notice you a little challenge 
while downloading files without
extencions AND the permision staff ;)

Problem 2:

i-Gallery lack of input validation for any user request . as a resault 
attacks
like cross-site scripting become possible , and steal stored cookies of 
secured
interface of i-Gallery become possible to name one example. 


Sample Exploit:

http://<host>/gallery/folderview.asp?folder=<script>alert
(document.cookie)</script>
