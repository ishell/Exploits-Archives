Logics Software Filetransfer from BS2000 Host to Web Client

* Release Date:
April 4, 2005

* Date noticed:
March 11, 2005

* Severity:
High (verified read access to any file and to-be-verified write access)

* Vendor:
Logics Sofware http://www.logics.de (http://www.logics.de/bs2000.htm)

* Systems Affected:
All BS2000 installed platforms both Microsoft WINDOWS and UNIX operating 
systems.

* Without authentication nor authorization it is possible to exploit 
"File Transfer from BS2000 Host to Web Client" just replacing the
  variables VAR_FT_*; VAR_FT_LANG manages the language that will be used 
for templates and VAR_FT_TMPL manages the template to be used.

Replacing VAR_FT_LANG with "c:\" (whatever) and VAR_FT_TMPL with the 
file we want to read (i.e: winnt/win.ini) we have read acces
to the resource requested (most files in the filesystem).

For example, 
http://www.myserver.com/logwebcgi/logwebftbs2000.exe?VAR_FT_LANG=c:\&VAR_FT_TMPL=winnt/win.ini 
will give us the contents for
  c:\winnt\win.ini.

In UNIX systems you can test the vulnerability just with:
http://www.myserver.com/logwebcgi/logwebftbs2000.exe?VAR_FT_LANG=/etc&VAR_FT_TMPL=passwd

We have not checked in deep the posibility of reading registry 
(c:\winnt\system32\config) nor SAM or other attack-relevant files, but 
we have confirmed ABSOLUTELY that in UNIX installations where the web 
server is running with privileged users (aka root or so) you can read 
files like /etc/shadow, /etc/master.passwd... so this vulnerability 
could escalate to something really dangerous depending on the specific 
system and what kind of webserver and webserver configuration they have.

Probably, anyone is able to UPLOAD files to the server as they will be 
managed by this tool, but we were not able to test it in our platform.


* Protection:
Check the way to lock the access to c:\ (/) resource from within this 
tool, but our recommendation is to directly remove access to the bs2000
ftp executables and tools (everything inside logwebcgi/ directory).

* Vendor Status:
Contacted but no response received.
