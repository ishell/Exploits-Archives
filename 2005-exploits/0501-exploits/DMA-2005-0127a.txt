Description: 
Mac OS X v10.3 Panther offers breakthroughs in innovation and ease of use that won't 
be seen in other operating systems for years, if ever, while its UNIX-based core 
provides rock-solid security on the Internet.

On 1/25/2005 Apple published an advisory for the "at" commands to address a local 
privilege escalation vulnerability. The "at" family of commands did not properly drop 
privileges. This could allow a local user to remove files not owned by them, run programs 
with added privileges, or read the contents of normally unreadable files. The update 
patched the commands at, atrm, batch, atq, and atrun. 

The following session outlines the behavior that was reported. 

Please note that at, batch, atq, atrm are all disabled by default on Mac OS X.  Each 
of these commands depend on the execution of atrun which has been disabled due to power 
management concerns.  Those who would like to use these commands, must first re-enable 
/usr/libexec/atrun by removing the leading '#' from the line
#*/5    *       *       *       *       root    /usr/libexec/atrun
in the file /etc/crontab.  

'atrm' can be used to delete any file on the system. The atrm vulnerability does not 
depend upon atrun.

'batch' can be used to execute commands as gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel), 1(daemon), 
2(kmem), 3(sys), 4(tty), 5(operator), 20(staff), 31(guest) 

CrunkJuice:/tmp kevinfinisterre$ echo > aa

CrunkJuice:/tmp kevinfinisterre$ batch -f /tmp/aa 0
Job b0118490c.000 will be executed using /bin/sh

CrunkJuice:/tmp kevinfinisterre$ cat /tmp/test
cat: /tmp/test: No such file or directory

(wait 5 minutes)

 4(tty), 5(operator), 20(staff), 31(guest), 80(admin)

'batch' can also be used to read any file on the system.
