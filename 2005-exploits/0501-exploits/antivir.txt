NOTE: Already posted to vuln-dev. Because I'm not receiving comments, I
believe that this one is real.

Dear list,

please inspect the following, your input is welcome. Vendors (Microsoft
and unspecified AV company) are contacted two months ago, I'm not
satisfied with their response and here is the post.
Someone from Microsoft told me that because the code needs to be
executed locally on the machine in the domain, it is not highly
critical for the mission. Perhaps I was able to better explain to them
what is happening, but I was irritated by the fact that we (my company)
paid them for several thousand licences, including the Data Center, and
the Microsoft technical support was not interested in exploring the
possibilities where this issue can lead. I felt a little bit
disappointed.


# A list of vulnerable applications/operating systems/device/etc with
version numbers and patch levels.

Windows NT, possibly *.*, tested on Windows 2000, XP, 2003 regardless
of patch level.


# A list of non-vulnerable applications/operating systems/devices/etc
with version numbers and patch levels.

Not tested with Windows NT 4.0, despite that, there are no known
non-vulnerable servers.
It is not possible (in my experience) to lock the machine from the
VBScript or JScript, please correct me if I'm wrong.


# A detailed discussion of the vulnerability and the environment in
which it was found.

Vuln was found in the production, on SQL servers, running 40+ days.
Vulnerability was discovered because one, for now unnamed Anti Virus
product, three months ago.
Anti Virus is not closing open registry handles, and that leads to the
lock up.

What happens?

<CLAIM>
If you open HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion key too
much (about 2^16) times from one process, even remotely, logged on at
least as Domain Guest, you are able to deny access to everyone through
the terminal services including domain admins, enterprise admins, etc.
Locally, you are denying access to the users whose profiles are not yet
created on particular machine, regardless of their privileges, because
the profile cannot be created and request fails with "Insufficient
resources" error.
</CLAIM>


# A detailed discussion on how to reproduce the vulnerability, possibly
including exploit programs.

Just log on to the domain, group membership required in default
(immediate post-install, no policy hardening) environment is "Domain
Guests".
Build and run HKLMLocker.exe. If you in addition pass the name of the
server as the argument, lock will be performed on that server.
Examples:

  HKLMLocker
    This will lock your local machine.

  HKLMLocker sql.fabrikam.microsoft.com
    This will lock Microsoft's one and only SQL server :)

  HKLMLocker.exe %userdomain%
    This will probably shoot your DC in the foot ;)

The cpp source follows. You will need tchar.h. Make your own "Lock the
domain" game, I didn't want to implement that functionality. But for
the script kiddie, it is not a problem to make a batch file :)

Solution is in the producer's hands, since no source code exists.
You can harden this particular registry key in order to additionaly
tighten the possibility of malicious locking.

I'm still trying to prove to the Anti Virus technical support that the
executable that leaks is theirs (what is clearly visible from
ProcExplorer / SysInternals.com), what is the problem etc., I'm pretty
irritated so far. In one week you will know the name of the Anti Virus
vendor if they decide to go by the hard lane. I already noticed them
several times, and during the period of three months I did everything
they needed, but we are on the beginning.

I hope that they are subscribed to Vuln-Dev@SecurityFocus.com.
(Or BugTraq@SecurityFocus.com)
