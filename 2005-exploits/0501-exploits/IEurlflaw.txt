All,

The following (very simple!) code calls a URL in the browser window but
fails to update the address bar in IE. Looks like the form submission is
suspended with the interrupt of the 'window.alert' call. IE then fails
to correctly handle.

Might be helpful in facilitating phishing style attacks. Assuming you
can spoof the original location.

I'm running windows XP SP2 with all the latest patches. It works
correctly in FireFox (i.e. the address bar does update).

Not sure if this really is a vulnerability, but would appreciate any
thoughts.

Thanks,

Graeme Stewart

P.S My apologies if this is a known vuln. I did do some searching (i.e.
Google!, but nothing similar came up).
