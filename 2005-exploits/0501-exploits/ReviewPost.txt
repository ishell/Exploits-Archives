Description:
Your community of users represents a wealth of knowledge. Now 
your users can help build and maintain your site by writing 
reviews of any product imaginable. With ReviewPost, you will 
quickly amass a valuable collection of user opinions about 
products that relate to your site. ReviewPost can even use 
your existing forum login system (if you have one) to keep your 
users from having to register twice, and makes an excellent 
companion to ReviewPost. Where you see [INT] in this advisory, 
it represents an integer such as a valid category. [XSS] and 
[SQL] represent where an attacker could insert code to conduct 
a cross site scripting attack, or inject data to influence SQL 
queries.



Cross Site Scripting:
ReviewPost is prone to cross site scripting in several
different scripts throughout the application.

http://path/showcat.php?si=[XSS]
http://path/showproduct.php?product=[INT]&sort=[INT]&cat=[INT][XSS]
http://path/showproduct.php?product=[INT]&sort=[INT]&cat=[INT]&page=[INT][XS
S]
http://path/reportproduct.php?report=[INT][XSS]

This can be used to render hostile code in the context of the 
victims browser, or to steal cookie based credentials or other 
sensitive info.



SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:
There are a couple of SQL Injection vulnerabilities in ReviewPost. 
Some are easy to exploit, others are not so easy. Examples are below:

http://path/showcat.php?cat=[INT][SQL]
http://path/addfav.php?product=[INT][SQL]&do=add

These SQL issues can possibly be exploited to influence SQL queries 
and disclose arbitrary data. These will alse cause XSS if unsuccessful.



Arbitrary File Upload:
This issue can be very dangerous as it allows a user to upload php 
scripts and other files. Once uploaded these files can be executed 
with the permission of the webserver. The uploaded file can be 
found by following the image link in the Review that was posted. 
Exploiting this vulnerability can be accomplished by naming a file with 
multiple file extensions and then uploading it when posting a review 
(for example: test.jpg.php.jpg.php). It should be noted that the uploads 
are properly filtered (or seem to be) when editing a review, just not when 
creating a new Review.



Solution:
ReviewPost 2.84 has been released to address these issues. Users should
upgrade their installation as soon as possible.
