Summary
========
JSBoard is one of widely used web BBS applications in Korea. Because of an
input validation flaw, a malicious attacker can read arbitrary files.

Vulnerability Class
===================
Implementation Error: Input validation flaw

Impact
======
Medium : arbitrary file disclosure

Affected Products
================
JSBoard 2.0.9 and prior.

Vendor Status: FIXED
====================

2005-01-20 Official release.

Details
=======
PHP has a feature discarding the input values containing null characters
when magic_quotes_gpc = off. Because JSBoard session.php doesn't sanitize
$table variable, a malicious attacker can read arbitrary files.

- ---
include_once "include/print.php";
parse_query_str();
$opt = $table ? "&table=$table" : "";
$opts = $table ? "?table=$table" : "";
