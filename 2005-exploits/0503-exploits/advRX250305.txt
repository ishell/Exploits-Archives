   VulnDiscovery:       2004/12/21
   Release Date :       2005/03/25
   Author       :       Gangstuck and Psirac <research@rexotec.com>

   Application  :       OpenMosixView
   Affected     :       All version (lastest is openmosixview-1.5)
   Platform     :       Linux
   Risk         :       Critical
   Severity     :       Allow local user to compromise filesystem.

   Vendor       :       http://www.openmosixview.com/
   Reference    :       http://www.rexotec.com/advisory/RX250305.html

   Status       :       Vendor has been notified (2005/02/17) and will try to 
                        fix the topics  listed above for the next  release of 
			OMView. This may  take some time  because  of general 
			architecture  changes  for  OpenMosix on 2.6. kernels.
			

 |=---[ - SUMMARY OVERVIEW
      `---------------------------------------------------------------------| 
      
   OpenMosix is a Linux kernel extension for single-system image clustering 
   which turns a network of ordinary computers into a supercomputer.
   
   OpenMosixView is an intuitive cluster-management GUI for openMosix cluster. 
   
   It contains eight usefull applications for monitoring and administrating 
   openMosix-cluster. In the package, OpenMosixCollector is the daemon 
   which should/could be started on one cluster-member. It logs openmosix
   load of each node. These history log-files are analyzed by some 
   openMosix Analyzer located in the pack to gives a non-stop overview 
   of the load, memory and processes in a cluster.
   
   
 |=-+-[ - VULNERABILITIES OVERVIEW 
    | `---------------------------------------------------------------------|  
    |
 .--+-[ OpenMosixView ]
 |   
 |  When OpenMosixView is started, it get nodes's names (or by default 
 |  nodes's IP) with "mosctl whois id_node_number", and redirect output 
 |  in /tmp/nodes.tmp without checking if file already exist, ...
 |   
 +--.
    |
    '--[ OpenMosixView->OpenmosixCollector ]
    
   At each start of the OpenMosixCollector daemon, load of each node is 
   formatted to the directory /tmp/openmosixcollector where data are 
   organised in several files. 
   
   The startup schema is :
   
   	[ file ] cluster
	[ file ] IDnode-n
	[ file ] IDnode-n
   	[ file ] sync.count
	[ dir  ] phist
	
   Permissions are correctly handled .. 
   
	drwxr-xr-x   3 root root  1024 2004-12-23 18:54 openmosixcollector
	|
	`-----  -rw-r--r--   1 root root 42674 2004-12-21 22:20 1
		-rw-r--r--   1 root root 42612 2004-12-21 22:20 11
		-rw-r--r--   1 root root 41444 2004-12-21 22:20 2
		-rw-r--r--   1 root root 42063 2004-12-21 22:20 22
		-rw-r--r--   1 root root 41486 2004-12-21 22:20 cluster
		drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 24576 2004-12-21 22:20 phist
		-rw-r--r--   1 root root     4 2004-12-21 22:20 sync.count
   
	
   but, creation of predictable files allow any local attacker to remove 
   arbitrary files on the vulnerable filesystem via the famous symlink 
   vulnerability. In this case, we just have to rebuild a fake directory 
   tree. 
   
   If openmosixcollector-daemon is already running there is also a way to 
   corrupt the fs due to the creation of a predictable backup temporary 
   directory each 12 hours (see exploit below for more details).

   Anyway, there is a way to exploit this case but this is not 
   implemented in this public exploit. OpenMosixcollector-daemon 
   automatically restarts every 12 hours and saves the current 
   history to a directory located in /tmp (glibc: P_tmpdir).
   
   This is done whith the utilisation of a predictable temporary
   dir name \"${OMCTDIR}_[date]\" where [date] format 
   look like \"18.0.2005-0.0.48\". Have phun :P"
   exit 0

echo -e "[-] OpenMosixCollector seems not to be started..."
