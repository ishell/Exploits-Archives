Description:
Kayako eSupport is a popular helpdesk, and support software. It 
is used by many businesses for customer support purposes. Kayako 
eSupport is prone to cross site scripting attacks that may allow 
the application to be used as an attack vector, or an attacker 
to access sensitive user data .


Cross Site Scripting:
Cross site scripting exists in Kayako eSupport. This vulnerability 
exists due to user supplied input not being checked properly. Below 
are a few benign examples of the previously mentioned issues.
