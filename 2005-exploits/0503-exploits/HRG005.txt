 Vulnerable: Forumwa_v1 (any version)  
  
 
 ---  
  
 General information:  
  
 Forumwa is a simple discussion forum, based on PHP 
and MYSQL. Beside the basic-features there are 
special functions like search function, user 
profiles, memberlist, mailer, feedback? 
Multilanguage, easy installation.  
  
  
 ---  
  
 Description:  
  
 The search.php script is vulnerable to a XSS attack 
by a remote attacker. The searched string is not 
filtered for any harmfull characters like < > and ". 
This makes it possible for an attacker to trick a 
user into going to a harmfull page and stealing a 
session.  
  
 Also, the body and the subject of a message posted 
on the forum are not checked for < or > characters. 
The combination of these two vulnerabilitys makes a 
real big problem.

 Proof Of Concept:  
  
 What this proof of concept will do is load a 1x1px 
IFrame from a message in the board that will abuse 
the search.php xss attack to change a viewers 
password to "wh00ters". How to use: make a post 
containing the following body and hope someone 
actually views the messages on the board. Once they 
open the link to view the post, their account is 
yours. Tip, make it a nice thread that people will 
reply to so you know who you compromised.
