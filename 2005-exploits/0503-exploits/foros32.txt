I discovered a security issue that affects the following my-forum.org release:

FOROS v.3.2 - http://my-forum.org/index.php?id=Ingles

When you are logged in with an account, you need edit the cookie of the site and change the value where your username is and replace it for the victim's username (example: Administrator).

The forum doesn't have a md5 password encryption and have a low security.
Example:
http://my-forum.org/moddatos.php?id=FORUMID&usuario=USERNAME

Change 'FORUMID' and 'USERNAME' and you can edit the profile of a user. Open the source code and search:

                <td width="60%" height=12><input name=password type=password id=password3

After that, you can get the username password

 value="USERNAMEPASSWORD" maxlength=200></td>
              </tr>
