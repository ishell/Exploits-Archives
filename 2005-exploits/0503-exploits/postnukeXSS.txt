PostNuke: The Phoenix Release (0.750) and (0.760-RC2)

PostNuke is an open source, open developement content management system
(CMS). PostNuke started as a fork from PHPNuke (http://www.phpnuke.org) and
provides many enhancements and improvements over the PHP-Nuke system. PostNuke
is still undergoing development but a large number of core functions are now
stabilising and a complete API for third-party developers is now in place.
If you would like to help develop this software, please visit our homepage

- --- 1. Critical XSS in Download module ---
When we go to this url :

http://[HOST]/[DIR]/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=AddDownload

or

We can add XSS by passing unexpected data to the 'Program name' or 'File link' or 'Author s name' or 'Author s e-mail address' or 'File size' or 'Version' or 'Home page' variable.

For exemple:

">&lt;script&gt;alert('cXIb8O3');&lt;/script&gt;


Why this XSS is critical ?
Because when admin login in and try to view new downloads, then our XSS will run on his machine.
Evil attacker can create dangerous XSS to steal data (admin cookie with session) or change the site.

- --- 2. How to fix ---

Download the new version of the script or update.
