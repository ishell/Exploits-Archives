1. Introduction
================
- From www.woodstone.nu:

Servers alive allows you to easily monitor hundreds of servers, or Internet 
services on a server, for uptime and availability. When it detects that a 
monitored service or computer has gone down it can make you aware through a 
variety of means.

2. Synopsis
============
A privilege-escalation vulnerability exists, allowing a local non-privileged 
user to obtain SYSTEM.

3. Discussion
==============
Servers Alive can be run in two modes; as an application or as a 
service.  When run as a service, the application is permitted to interact 
with the desktop and runs under the context of SYSTEM.  When loading the 
'Local manual' under help, the application does not drop privileges.  
Consequently, it is possible to assume SYSTEM privileges by:

Viewing the source of the help file, which opens in Notepad.
In Notepad, selecting File, Open.
Launching a system utility such as cmd.exe.

4. Impact
==========
Full local compromise of the host on which Servers Alive is installed.

5. Resolution and/or workaround
================================
The vendor considers this to be a problem with Visual Basic, the language in 
which the application is written.  The vendor has no immediate plans to fix 
the bug and will update documentation to reflect the risks associated with 
running the application under the local SYSTEM account and allowing desktop 
interaction.

To workaround this bug, the following recommendations may be helpful:
- -Only allow trusted users with Administrator-level privileges to logon 
interactively.
- -Physically secure the server on which the application is installed.
- -Do not run the application as a service.
