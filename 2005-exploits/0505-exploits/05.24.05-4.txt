Ipswitch IMail Web Calendaring Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 05.24.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=242&type=vulnerabilities
May 24, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Ipswitch Collaboration Suite (ICS) is a comprehensive communication and 
collaboration solution for Microsoft Windows with a customer base of 
over 53 million users. More information is available on the vendor's 
website:

     http://www.ipswitch.com/products/IMail_Server/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a directory traversal vulnerability in Ipswitch 
Inc.'s Imail Web Calendaring server allows attackers to read arbitrary 
files with System privileges. 

The problem specifically exists because of a flaw in the handling of 
requests for nonexistent javascript (jsp) files. By requesting a 
nonexistent jsp file followed by a question mark, several sequences of 
"..\" and then the path to a file on the system, an attacker can read 
arbitrary files remotely without any authentication. 

The following query demonstrates how the system's boot.ini file may be 
retrieved: 

GET /bla.jsp?\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\boot.ini HTTP/1.0
Connection: Close
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT 5.0)
Pragma: no-cache 

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to retrieve arbitrary 
files from the target host. Exploitation does not require authentication

and does not require exploit code, as a user can simply type the 
malicious query in a web browser.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the latest

version of Ipswitch IMAIL, version 8.13. It is suspected that earlier 
versions are also vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Limit access to the Web Calandaring server by allowing only trusted 
hosts to access TCP port 8484, the default port for Web Calandaring. If 
the Web Calandaring service is not required, disable it entirely.
