ISSUE
  PmWiki 2.0.12 is subject to a XSS vulnerability. The
  problem exists in the 'q' parameter passed to the search
  function. Successful exploitation may allow for
  impersonification through session stealing.

[pmwiki_basedir]/Site/Search?action=search&q=TRY%20ANOTHER%20SEARCH%20NOW!%20YES,%20YOU!'%20onMouseOver='alert(document.title);'%20

  This issue is caused by insufficient input validation.

  Server: Prevent access to pagelist.php.
