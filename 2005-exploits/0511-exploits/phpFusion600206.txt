   Description:

	"...a light-weight open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP. 
	It utilises a mySQL database to store your site content and includes a simple, 
	comprehensive adminstration system. PHP-Fusion includes the most common features 
	you would expect to see in many other CMS packages...."
	[http://php-fusion.co.uk/]


   Details:

	1) /subheader.php
	  Although PHP-Fusion has a good protection against path discolure, it looks like they've forgetten to
	  include this protection here.

	2) /forum/options.php

	  if (iMEMBER) {
		$data = dbarray(dbquery("SELECT * FROM ".$db_prefix."forums WHERE forum_id='".$forum_id."'"));


	  If the Forum is activated and you are logged in you can insert malicious code into the databse 
	  trough the $forum_id variable.

	
	  /forum/viewforum.php?forum_id=4&lastvisited='[SQL injection]

	3) /forum/viewforum.php

	if (empty($lastvisited)) { $lastvisited = time(); }

	[...]

	$new_posts = dbcount("(post_id)", "posts", "thread_id='".$data['thread_id']."' and post_datestamp>'$lastvisited'");

	To exploit this vulnerability you have to be logged out and a minimum of one thread should be
	posted in this forum.
	Malicious code can be inserted by requesting the following HTTP-request:

	http://www.example.com/forum/viewforum.php?forum_id=1&lastvisited='
	   
	   
   Patch:
          Set magic_quotes_gpc to ON.
