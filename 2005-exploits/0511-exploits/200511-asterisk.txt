Assurance.com.au - Vulnerability Advisory
-----------------------------------------------
Release Date:
 07-Nov-2005

Software:
 Asterisk Web-VoiceMail (Comedian VoiceMail)
 http://www.asterisk.org/

 Asterisk is a complete PBX in software. It runs on Linux, BSD and MacOSX and 
 provides all of the features you would expect from a PBX and more. 
 Asterisk does voice over IP in many protocols, and can interoperate with almost
 all standards-based telephony equipment using relatively inexpensive hardware.

Versions affected:
 Asterisk Versions <= 1.0.9
 Asterisk Beta Versions <= 1.2.0-beta1
 Asterisk @ Home Versions <= 1.5
 Asterisk @ Home Beta Versions <= 2.0 Beta 4 


Vulnerability discovered:

 A vulnerability in the voicemail retrieval system allows an authenticated
 user to download any .wav/.WAV file from the system, including other
 users voicemail messages.

Vulnerability impact:

 Low - Insecure web-ui causes breach of privacy

Vulnerability information

 vmail.cgi doesn't clean a parameter passed by the web user which is
 later used to open a file and return a raw stream to the user.
 This allows any authenticated user of the voicemail system to listen to
 other peoples messages, or to open any file with the extension .wav/.WAV
 on the system.

 Example:
  http://asterisk.example.org/cgi-bin/vmail.cgi?action=audio& \
  folder=../201/INBOX&mailbox=200&context=default&password=12345 \
  &msgid=0001&format=wav

 This will return /var/spool/asterisk/voicemail/default/201/INBOX/msg0001.wav
 when logged in as the 'extension 200' user.

Solution:
 Asterisk has released patches for the vulnerabilities.
 Ensure you are running Asterisk versions > 1.0.9 / 1.2.0-beta1
 Ensure you are running Asterisk @ Home versions > 1.5 / 2.0 beta 4
