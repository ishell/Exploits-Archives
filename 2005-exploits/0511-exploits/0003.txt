AFFECTED APPLICATION OR SERVICE
  TikiWiki
  http://tikiwiki.org/


AFFECTED VERSION
  1.9.x up to and including 1.9.2
  Possibly versions < 1.9 (untested)


BACKGROUND
  "Tikiwiki is a full featured Free Software (GNU/LGPL)
  Wiki/CMS/Groupware written in PHP and maintained by an
  active and international community of benevolent
  contributors."


ISSUE 1 (XSS)
  A XSS vulnerability has been detected in the fora code
  of TikiWiki. The problem is caused by insufficient input
  sanitation.

  The following partial URL demonstrates the issue:

[baseURL]/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?forumId=1&comments_parentId=0&topics_offset=10%22%20onmouseover='javascript:alert(document.title)%3B'%3E[PLEASE%20MOVE%20YOUR%20MOUSE%20POINTER%20HERE!]%20%3Cx%20y=%22

  Please move your mouse pointer over the input field
  which says so.


ISSUE 2 (Information Disclosure, possible SQL injection)

  The application discloses the installation path. This
  *may* also be useable to craft an SQL injection.

  The following partial URL demonstrates the issue:

[baseURL]/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?forumId=1&comments_parentId=0&topics_sort_mode=FOOBAH


WORKAROUND
  Issue 1: Disable Javascript (client) or deny access to
  TikiWiki (server).
  Issue 2: Set PHP to log errors to file only (issue 2).


SOLUTIONS
  We are not aware of a maintainer provided fix.
