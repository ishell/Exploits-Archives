= Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in BibORB =
================================================

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in BibORB which result in SQL 
injection, XSS, directory traversal and arbitrary file upload.

== Details ==
=============

Product: BibORB
Affected Version: 1.3.2, probably all lower versions
Immune Version: 1.3.2 Security Update, 1.3.3 RC1
OS affected: all
Security-Risk: high
Remote-Exploit: yes
Vendor-URL: http://biborb.glymn.net/
Vendor-Status: notified
CVE: CAN-2005-0251 - 0254


== Introduction ==
==================

"BibORB is a web-interface to BibTeX bibliographies (the bibliographic 
system used with LaTeX). It offers an easy to use solution to manage and 
share BibTeX bibliographies and electronic releases of papers."
(from maintainer's page)

XSS, SQL injection, directory traversal and arbitrary file upload make 
it possible to completely compromise the application and its users.

== More Details ==
==================

=== XSS ===
===========

CAN-2005-0251

Some variables containing user data are not filtered, so XSS is possible.

=== Proof of Concept ===
========================

http://path/to/biborb/bibindex.php?mode=displaysearch&search=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27XSS%27%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&sort=ID

or

Add Database -> Description: <script>alert('XSS')</script>

executed everytime the Database is shown.


=== SQL Injection ===
=====================

CAN-2005-0252

If MySQL is used as authorization backend, SQL Injection may be used to 
get admin status.

=== Proof of Concept ===
========================

When logging in, use the following username and password:

Username: x' or 1=1 or login='x
Password: x') or 1=1 or password=md5('x


=== Directory Traversal ===
===========================

CAN-2005-0253

If a user has the right to delete database entries, arbitrary files 
accessable by the user under which the application runs may be deleted.

=== Proof of Concept ===
========================

http://path/to/biborb/index.php?mode=result&database_name=../config.php&action=Delete


=== Arbitrary file upload ===

CAN-2005-0254

When a new entry is created, the user is presented with a mask where PDF 
and PS files can be uploaded as an addition to the entry. There is no 
check what files the user uploads, and those files are linked with 
standard icons widely used to show that the file is a PDF or PS file. 
Users may be fooled to click the icon and download malicious code 
instead of the desired PDF or PS file.

=== Proof of Concept ===
========================

Just upload some arbitrary data file when creating a new entry.


== Fix ==
=========

Update to either BibORB 1.3.2 Security Update or to 1.3.3 RC1.


== Security Risk ==
===================

High, because the application can be completely compromised.
