Product Name: HP PSC 2510
Summary: Ftp print service is not configurable

	This printer comes with an ftp daemon which allows anonymous
access, and drops the user into a write only directory.  By default
anyone from anywhere can drop a file into this directory and the
printer will print the document.  There is no documentation about
this feature, nor is there anyway to change (enable/disable) it
via any of their software or on the printer itself.  HP Tech.
support says that if you don't want this feature then you should
hook up the printer as a local printer, however this printer
comes with both wireless and wired connectors on the back.
