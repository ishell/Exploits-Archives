Synopsis:  Linux kernel scm_send local DoS
Product:   Linux kernel
Version:   2.4 up to and including 2.4.28, 2.6 up to and including 2.6.9
Vendor:    http://www.kernel.org/
URL:       http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0019-scm.txt
CVE:       CAN-2004-1016
Author:    Paul Starzetz <ihaquer@isec.pl>
Date:      Dec 14, 2004


Issue:
======

A  locally  exploitable  flaw  has been found in the Linux socket layer,
that allows a local user to hang a vulnerable machine.


Details:
========

The Linux kernel provides a powerful socket API  to  user  applications.
Among other functions sockets provide an universal way for IPC and user-
kernel communication. The socket layer uses several  logical  sublayers.
One  of  the  layers,  so called auxiliary message layer (or scm layer),
augments the socket API by  an  universal  user-kernel  message  passing
capability (see recvfrom(2) for more details on auxiliary messages).

One  of  the  scm  message  parsing  functions  invoked  from the kernel
sendmsg() code is __scm_send() and suffers from a deadlock condition  if
carefully  prepared  auxiliary  message(s)  is  sent  to  a socket by an
unprivileged application.

We believe that the 2.4 kernel branch is not  further  exploitable.  The
2.6  branch  has not been extensively checked, however it may be locally
exploitable to gain elevated privileges due to its increased complexity.


Discussion:
=============

See attached code.


Impact:
=======

Unprivileged local users may hang a vulnerable Linux machine.
