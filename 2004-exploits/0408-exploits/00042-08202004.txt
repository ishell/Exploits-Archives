# Vendor  : BadBlue
# URL     : http://www.badblue.com
# Version : BadBlue Webserver v2.5
# Risk    : Denial of Service
##########################################################

Description:
Share photos, videos, music, and business files with friends 
and colleagues instantly. Tired of paying a service to share 
your files (and the hassle of sending your files to their 
site) BadBlue shares files directly from your own PC, using 
the cable /DSL/broadband/dialup connection you already paid 
for! BadBlue lets you run a no-hassle Web site on your own 
PC for free, including a domain name you can choose. Within 
seconds, you can transform your PC into a friendly, file 
sharing Web server with all the power of a real server on the 
Internet. Remote users can search for files, explore your 
shared folders, and run full-blown applications created in 
HTML, PHP, Perl, and so on.



Denial of Service:
BadBlue Webserver cannot handle multiple connections from the 
same host, and will deny all acess to any users at right around 
twenty four simultaneous connections.I have included a proof of 
concept that floods the target server with a number of connections, 
and then basically keeps those connections up for as long as you 
specify, thus blocking all other traffic to the affected server.

Solution:
The development team has been contacted and said they will be 
looking into this issue shortly. Users are advised to upgrade 
as soon as possible.
