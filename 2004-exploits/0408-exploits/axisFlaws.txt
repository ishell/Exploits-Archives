/* Public disclosure due lack of responce from Axis Communications */

I have found a couple of bugs in Axis Network Camera/Video Servers.
(I have all Axis stuff in one e-mail, instead of multiple, lazy me.. ;)

Vulnerable: Axis 2100/2110/2120/2420/2130 Network Camera, 2400/2401 Video Server.
(There may be more devices vulnerable)

Included files (some is simple shell scripts):
axis-passwd.sh ........... Get /etc/passwd as 'anonymous viewer' v2.34/2.40
axis-wh00t.sh ............ Add admin account as 'anonymous viewer' v2.12-2.40 (whoops!)
axis-cgi.txt ............. [bonus] Not so mutch bugs here, but nice to know ;)
axis-storpoint-cd-E100.txt [bonus] Hardcoded l/p in Storepoint CD servers

Check each section for more details.

Quote of the day: Never say "whoops!", always say "Ah, Interesting!"
