Description:
Keene Digital Media Server is an easy and affordable way to 
share all things digital with friends, family, and customers 
over your broadband connection. DMS turns your computer into 
a highly secure Web server that automatically converts your 
files and folders into Web pages, thumbnails, and media shows 
with no Web programming required. Integrated user and file 
access security management provide the ultimate control over 
your content.


Directory Traversal Vulnerability:
Not too long ago I saw there was a directory traversal vuln
found in Keene Digital Media Server. it was fixed by the
developers, but

http://localhost/%2E%2E%5Csystem.log

It seems that only ../ and %2E%2E/ were filtered out. If you
hex encode the backslash or use a forward slash you can then
traverse out of the web directory. For example I am able to
grab the server log file with the above request.



Related Info:
The original advisory can be found at the following location

Solution:
I contacted the developers but never received a response.
