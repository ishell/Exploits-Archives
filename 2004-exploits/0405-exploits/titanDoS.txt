 Titan FTP Server Aborted LIST DoS
----------------------------------------------------


Article reference:
http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/5RP0215CUU.html


SUMMARY

A security vulnerability exists in South River Technologies' Titan FTP Server. 
An attacker issuing a LIST command and disconnecting before the LIST command 
had the time to connect, will cause the program to try and access an invalid 
socket. This will result in the FTP service's crash (and in turn, no longer 
being able to service any additional users).

  * Titan FTP Server version 3.01 build 163

 Immune Systems:
  * Titan FTP Server version 3.10 build 169
