2. The bugs:
-------------

[1] directory traversal bug, the program does't make a good check on
    the user input string ( /../ ) so an attacker is able to see and
    download all the files on the remote system simply using his
    browser.

[2] cross site scripting bug, the program doesn't make a full check
    on the strings sent by the client, in fact the input strings are
    not filtered and they will appear in the returned page.
