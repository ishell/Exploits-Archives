Major Bug found 6/7/04

Discovered by Verb0s 

Reseller accounts with cpanel, in the password modification page, can insert a basic injection ex:http://(domain):2086/scripts/passwd?password=<>&domain=<>&user=<>

The code will modify all the mysql database passwords, in which the reseller shouldnb't have permissions. From there, someone could take over someones site that may be sql based, on the same server as them. 

How to fix the problem:

After my immediate contact with cpanel. they updated and fixed all permission problems : 6/8/04

Update your Cpanel ASAP
