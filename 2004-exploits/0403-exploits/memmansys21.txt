#Vulnerabilities: 

Input Validation Holes Permit SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting 
Attacks. 

#SQL Injection# 

A problem of sanitation in resend.asp, news_view.asp, could lead an attacker 
to inject SQL code to manipulate and disclose information from the database.
The same problem is present in administration site in more scripts. 

Examples:
http://[host]/resend.asp?ID=[SQL query]
http://[host]/news_view.asp?ID=[SQL query] 

#Cross-Site Scripting# 

Another problem of sanitation permits an attacker inject a XSS in the 
register form (register.asp), this will be executed at the administration 
site permitting the attacker to modify or delete data.
Also is possible a XSS attack in error.asp. 

Example:
http://[host]/error.asp?err=">[XSS]
Example to delete a user:
In the register form: "><iframe src=http://[host]/admin/user_del.asp?ID=[ID 
to delete]>
