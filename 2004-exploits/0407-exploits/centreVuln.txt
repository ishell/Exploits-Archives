Summary: [www.miller-group.net] The Miller Group, Inc. announces the release 
of Centre, a free student information system for public and non-public 
schools. Centre is a web-based, open source, student management product with 
features that include scheduling, grade book, attendance, eligibility, 
transcripts, and more. And, of course, student and employee information 
screens are critical components of Centre.

Version: 1.0

Exploit: There is no sanity checking anywhere in Centre. In effect an 
unprivileged user can change administrator options and could lead to 
privilege escalation. This includes but is not limited to creating new 
accounts:

There is also improper checking in the modules.php file this could allow PHP 
script injection. No validation is done on the module path.

Fix: Disable centre until an update is released (the problems are too 
extensive).
