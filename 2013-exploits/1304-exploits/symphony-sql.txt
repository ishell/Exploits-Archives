Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered SQL injection vulnerability in Symphony, which can be exploited to alter SQL requests to database of the vulnerable application.


1) SQL Injection in Symphony: CVE-2013-2559

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of "sort" HTTP GET parameter passed via "/symphony/system/authors/" URL to "/index.php" script. A remote authenticated administrator can execute arbitrary SQL commands in the application's database.

Depending on database and system configuration, this PoC (Proof of Concept) code will create "/var/www/file.txt"  file, containing users account information (logins, hashed passwords, etc.) from the "authors" table:

http://[host]/symphony/system/authors/?order=asc&sort=id%20INTO%20OUTFILE%20%27/var/www/file.txt%27%20--%20


This vulnerability could also be exploited by a remote non-authenticated attacker via CSRF vector, since the application is prone to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. In order to do so an attacker should trick the logged-in administrator to visit a web page with CSRF exploit:

<img src="http://[host]/symphony/system/authors/?order=asc&sort=id%20INTO%20OUTFILE%20%27/var/www/file.txt%27%20--%20">
