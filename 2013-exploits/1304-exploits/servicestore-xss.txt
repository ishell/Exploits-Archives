Cross-Site Scripting attacks are a type of injection problem, in which malicious
scripts are injected into the otherwise benign and trusted web sites.
Cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send
malicious code,
generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end
user. Flaws that allow
these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web
application uses
input from a user in the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user.
The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not
be trusted, and will execute the script.
Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious
script can access any cookies,
session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by your
browser and used with that site.
These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.


Impact:
XSS gives a attacker a lot of attacking vectors, including:
Session Hijacking: stealing the user session cookie
Phishing Attacks
MITM Attacks: Intercepting data.
