Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Nitro Pro is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers execute arbitrary
code. An attacker can exploit this issue by enticing a legitimate user to use
the vulnerable application to open a file from a remote WebDAV or SMB share
which contains a specially crafted DLL.

Affected DLL: bcgcbproresen.dll (tested on Windows 8)


Proof of concept:
-----------------
Create a DLL with desired code, name it bcgcbproresen.dll and place it within
the same folder as a *.pdf or *.fdf file.
