Description
----------------
nrpe 2.13 has, in src/nrpc.c, line 52:

#define NASTY_METACHARS         "|`&><'\"\\[]{};"

This allows the passing of $() to plugins/scripts which, if run under
bash, will execute that shell command under a subprocess and pass the
output as a parameter to the called script. Using this, it is possible
to get called scripts, such as check_http, to execute arbitrary
commands under the uid that NRPE/nagios is running as (typically,
'nagios').

Solution
------------
Upgrade to NRPE 2.14 or later, available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagios/files/nrpe-2.x/
