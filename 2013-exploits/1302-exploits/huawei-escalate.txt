1. DESCRIPTION

Huawei Mobile Partner application contains a flaw that may allow an
attacker to gain access to unauthorized privileges. The issue is due
to the application installing with insecure permissions. This allows a
less privileged local attacker or compromised process to replace the
original application binary with a malicious application which will be
executed by a victim user or upon Mobile Partner application Windows
service restart.


2. BACKGROUND

allow you to connect to the 3G mobile network for Internet access. It
is widely used by many telcos round the world.
