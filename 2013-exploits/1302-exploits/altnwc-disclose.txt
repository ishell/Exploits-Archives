VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION:
==========================
Alt-N WorldClient application is prone to an authentication
credentials disclosure via a specially formulated HTTP request. This
is possible because the application replies to the request with a
response that contains the credentials in an encoded (reversible)
format.

Attackers may trick an unsuspecting user into opening a malicious
email message -using the WorldClient application- and stealing his/her
authentication credentials without the user ever noticing.

Alt-N MDaemon v13.0.3 & v12.5.6 were tested and found vulnerable;
other versions may also be affected.
