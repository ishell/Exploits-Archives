Advisory Details:
The camera’s web interface uses HTTP Basic for authentication, but authentication details are only validated on the 

home login page. By forced browsing, or navigating directly to any valid URL on the web interface other than the 

homepage, it is possible to bypass authentication.

Risk:
It's possible to view the live video feed and/or change all configurable settings anonymously.
 
Proof of Concept:
Navigate directly to http://x.x.x.x/cgi-bin/display.cgi to view the camera’s live video feed anonymously.
 
Solution:
Upgrade to firmware version 030405.
