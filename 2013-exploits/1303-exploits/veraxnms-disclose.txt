Verax NMS Password Disclosure (CVE-2013-1631)

I. BACKGROUND
----------------------
Verax NMS provides a service-oriented, unified
management & monitoring of networks, applications
and infrastructure enabling quick problem detection,
root-cause analysis, reporting and automating recovery,
reducing costs and shortening downtimes of IT service delivery.

II. DESCRIPTION
----------------------
>From within the Verax NMS Console, users can navigate to
monitored devices and perform predefined actions (NMSAction),
such as repairing tables on a MySQL database or restarting
services.  When these actions are initiated, the AMF response
from the application leaks the plaintext connection details to
the client and may do so over an unencrypted connection.  This
behavior would allow an unprivileged user to recover sensitive
connection details for arbitrary services and applications
monitored by Verax NMS.

III. AFFECTED PRODUCTS
----------------------
All versions of Verax NMS prior to 2.1.0 are vulnerable.

IV. RECOMMENDATION
----------------------
Users should upgrade to version 2.1.0 of Verax NMS.

V. CREDIT
----------------------
This vulnerability was discovered by Andrew Brooks.
