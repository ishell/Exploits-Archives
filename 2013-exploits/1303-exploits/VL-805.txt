Details:
========
A persistent input validation web vulnerability is detected in the official Paypal GP+ service application for anlayzing websites.

The vulnerability is located in the pop up message of the delete button where the name of the website, that has been analyzed, 
is not sanitized, hence the malicious code gets executed. The delete button is located in two different places which are 
`Recent  analysis` and `all analysis` listings. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires low user interaction.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in persistent session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external 
redirects, persistent external malware loads via inject and persistent vulnerable module web context manipulation.

Vulnerable Section(s):
				[+] Paypal GP+ - (https://www.paypal-gpplus.com/en/dashboard/all/)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Analyze a new website

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Website field out of the pop up message

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Recent Analysis - All Analysis


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user interaction and without privileged application user account.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC: 
The attacker should go and insert the malicious code in the field of the website he would like to search it. After that, 
he should click on "Scan URL". The scan will generate an error because the url is invalid, but when the user goes back to his dashboard 
and choose Recent Analysis/All Analysis, and he stops with his mouse pointer no the delete icon in the page, the malicious code will be executed.
