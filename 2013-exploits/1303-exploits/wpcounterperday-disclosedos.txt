Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in
.../websites/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/count-per-day/notes.php on
line 85
---------------------
--> DENIAL OF SERVICE, unability to enter or view notes anymore
--> the structure of the wordpress stored object (wp_options WHERE
option_name='count_per_day_notes') is corrupted. did not take time
analyzing if this could leak to php code execution. this is unlikely
to be achieved.
