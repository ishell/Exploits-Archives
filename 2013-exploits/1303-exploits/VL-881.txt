Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered a file include web vulnerability in the mobile USB Disk & File Transfer v1.3.1 app for the apple ipad & iphone.


Report-Timeline:
================
2013-02-20:	Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
Apple
Product: USB Disk & File Transfer 1.3.1


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
A local file include web vulnerability via POST request method is detected in the mobile USB Disk & File Transfer v1.3.1 app for the apple ipad & iphone.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers via POST method to inject local app webserver folders to request unauthorized local webserver files.

The vulnerbility is located in the upload file module of the webserver (http://192.168.0.102:8080) when processing to load a manipulated 
name or path via POST. The execution of the injected path or name of the file request will occur when the attacker is processing to watch 
the file dir listing on the main index site.

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires no user interaction and can be done without privileged application user account (no password standard).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized path or file access via local file or path include attack.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] USB Disk & File Transfer v1.3.1 - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] File Upload  (Web Server) [Remote]

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] name
				[+] path

Affected Module(s):
				[+] File Dir Index Listing


Proof of Concept:
=================
The local file include web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account and 
also without required user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
http://192.168.0.102:8080/files/?_=[FILE OR PATH INCLUDE VULNERABILITY!]


Review: Index Listing - Name & Path

{"currentDir":"","files":[{"name":"[FILE INCLUDE VULNERABILITY!].png","tam":"27.3 KB","date":"18.02.13 23:18",
"type":"FILE","path":"[PATH INCLUDE VULNERABILITY!.png","id":0},{"name":"8765434.png","tam":"228.5 KB","date":"18.02.13 

23:23","type":"FILE","path":"8765434.png","id":1}]}


Manually steps to reproduce ...
1. Start the application or scan for a available application
2. Visit the web interfact by opening the following network ip 192.168.0.102:8080 in your browser
3. Start the your session tamper to manipulate the next POST request
4. Choose a file to upload and activate the tamper
5. Replace the path or name values with your own local app path or local file to request after sending
6. Send the data to the webserver via POST and watch the index listing to provoke the execution out of the file dir listing (name & path)
7. Successful reproduced!

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the local file/path include web vulnerability via POST request method is estimated as high(+).
