Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered two null pointer dereference vulnerabilities in Corel Quattro Pro. Opening of a malicious QPW (Quattro Pro Spreadsheet) document causes immediate application crash, resulting in a loss of all unsaved current application data of the user.


1) Multiple Null Pointer Dereference vulnerabilities in Corel Quattro Pro X6: CVE-2012-4728

1.1 The first crash occurs in the QPW160.dll module at the QProGetNotebookWindowHandle function when the application tries to move a value to a corrupted pointer. Due to the malformed QPW file the EDX register will contain a null value. This destination pointer used to store the value of the AX register will be therefore invalid, which causes the application to crash instantly.

Crash details:

eax=04b11e00 ebx=00007020 ecx=000000f5 edx=00000000 esi=00000000 edi=04b10048
eip=202e5925 esp=0012d9b0 ebp=0012e8e8 iopl=0         nv up ei pl zr na pe nc
cs=001b  ss=0023  ds=0023  es=0023  fs=003b  gs=0000             efl=00010246

QPW160!QProGetNotebookWindowHandle+0x23cb85:
202e5925 6689048a        mov     word ptr [edx+ecx*4],ax  ds:0023:000003d4=????



1.2 The second crash occurs in the QPW160.dll module at the Ordinal132 function when the application tries to copy a buffer from ESI to EDI. Due to the abnormal QPW file the EDI register is not properly initialized, which causes the dereference of the EDI pointer to a null value. After this, the code is not able to catch the issue due to a lack of exception handling, forcing the application to crash immediately.

Crash details:

eax=00000000 ebx=00000000 ecx=00000002 edx=00000000 esi=04ca6c40 edi=00000000

In order to exploit these vulnerabilities remotely, the attacker has to send a malicious file to the victim by email. In a web-based scenario, the attacker can host a malicious file on a website or WebDav share and trick the victim to download and open the file. 

As a PoC (Proof of Concept) two files "1.qpw" and "2.qpw" are <a href="https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/HTB23112-PoC.rar">provided</a>, which cause immediate application crash. Password for archive: ph77=!3=L
