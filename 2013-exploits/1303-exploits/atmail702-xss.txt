INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2013-004
- Original release date: March 9th, 2013
- Last revised:  March 25th, 2013
- Discovered by: Vicente Aguilera Diaz
- Severity: 4.3/10 (CVSSv2 Base Scored)
- CVE-ID: CVE-2013-2585
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Reflected XSS in the view attachment message process of the Atmail
WebMail <= v7.0.2

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Atmail allows users to access IMAP Mailboxes of any server of your
choice. The software provides a comprehensive email-suite for
accessing user mailboxes, and provides an inbuilt Calendar and
Addressbook features. The WebMail Client of Atmail supports any
existing IMAP server running under Unix/Linux or Windows systems.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Has been detected a reflected XSS vulnerability in the view attachment
message process of the Atmail WebMail, that allows the execution of
arbitrary HTML/script code to be executed in the context of the victim
user's browser.

The code injection is done through the file name parameter, and
requires that the user victim is authenticated in the WebMail.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
When a user opens a file attachment in an email, the link is as follows:

http://<atmail-server>/index.php/mail/viewmessage/getattachment/folder/INBOX/uniqueId/<ID>/filenameOriginal/<file>

where:
- <atmail-server> is the Atmail WebMail server
- <ID> is the unique ID for the message that contains the attachment
- <file> is the attachment file in the message

A malicious user can inject arbitrary HTML/script code in the <file>
parameter. For example:

http://<atmail-server>/index.php/mail/viewmessage/getattachment/folder/INBOX/uniqueId/<ID>/filenameOriginal/test.txt<H1><marquee>This+is+an+XSS+example

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or script code in a targeted
user's browser, this can leverage to steal sensitive information as
user credentials, personal data, etc.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
Tested in Atmail 7.0.2. Other versions may be affected too.

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Update to version 7.0.3.
