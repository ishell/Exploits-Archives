Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple vulnerabilities in Chocolate WP theme for 
WordPress. This is commercial theme for WP.

These are Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse of 
Functionality, Denial of Service and Arbitrary File Upload vulnerabilities.

In 2011 I wrote about Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08), Full path disclosure 
(WASC-13), Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42) and Denial of Service (WASC-10) 
vulnerabilities in TimThumb and multiple themes for WordPress 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/4910/), and later also was disclosed Arbitrary 
File Uploading (WASC-31) vulnerability. In previous years I've wrote about 
multiple vulnerabilities in 145 WP themes (http://websecurity.com.ua/4915/) 
and here is another theme.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of Chocolate WP theme for WordPress. Earlier 
I've informed developers about these vulnerabilities.

(bypass of restriction on domain, if such restriction is turned on)

About such Abuse of Functionality and Denial of Service vulnerabilities you 
can read in my article Using of the sites for attacks on other sites 
(http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-June/075384.html).

Besides index.php there are also potentially FPD in other php-files of this 
theme.
