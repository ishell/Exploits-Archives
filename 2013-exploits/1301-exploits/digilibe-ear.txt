Description:
Execution After Redirect vulnerabilities exist in DigiLIBE Management 
Console versions 3.4 and possibly other versions. This allows remote 
attackers to retrieve sensitive data that should only be returned to 
authenticated users.
By not properly terminating the code after redirection an 
unauthenticated attacker can choose to not follow the redirect and view 
the normally protected content.
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability resulted obtaining the 
contents of the 'General Configuration'.

Exploit steps for proof-of-concept:
1.    Using a proxy such as Burp Proxy intercept request: 
https://vulnerablehost.com/configuration/general_configuration.html
2.    Send to repeater.
3.    View response.

Vendor Notified: Yes
Vendor Response: November 11, 2012 - Deployed security update. Version 
not confirmed.
