Hello list!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in WordPress Attack 
Scanner plugin for WordPress.

These are Information Leakage vulnerabilities. This is security plugin. In 
my 63 advisories about different vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3397/) I've wrote about security plugins many 
times. Previous time it was plugin Wordfence Security.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of WordPress Attack Scanner - both Free and Pro 
(commercial) versions of the plugin. Checked in WP-Attack-Scanner-Free 
0.9.5.beta.

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/path/data.txt

http://site/wp-content/plugins/path/archive.txt

Folder "path" can be WP-Attack-Scanner or WP-Attack-Scanner-Free.

Unrestricted access to the data - they can be accessed in the browser 
without authorization. Even the data is encrypted, but by default the 
password is "changepassword". If the password was not changed, then the data 
is easily decrypting. If it was changed, then the password can be picked up.
