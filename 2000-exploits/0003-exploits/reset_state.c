A brief rundown of the problem.

If you run routable ips on your internal interface on your pix, and
routeable ips on your external interface, so the pix is not running nat,
the pix keeps a state table of everything going on.  Anything that is not
in your state table that attempts to come in from the outside is denied,
even if there is a conduit in place to permit anything.  Which means that
you have to establish a connection from your internal network to your
external network before anything external can send data back.  This is a
really nice feature, unfortunatly there is a bit of a bug that I found in
this.  While testing on in house equipment for possible flaws, as we
continually test various products, I found the following.

On recieving a RST packet (TCP Reset) from a given host with the correct
source and destination port, the PIX will drop the state entry for that
particular connection, which means the tcp connection dies due to the fact
that no state entry the external box can no longer talk to the internal
box.

So, if we take a standard raw ip packet, give it a tcp header, and set the
source ip as a machine that your internal box is connected to, and the
destination ip as your internal machine, set the source port on the
spoofed ip as the port the person is connected to, set your destination
port on your destination ip cyclically to possible source ports on his
side, and send resets, it will drop the persons state table entry, cutting
him off from the box he is connected to.

I would like to note at this point that this exploit does NOT work against
firewall-1 due to an interesting technique used to fix the problem, when
firewall-1 recieves a TCP Reset, it simply drops its state table timeout
from
3600 seconds to 50 seconds, and should no data be recieved between the two
hosts
within 50 seconds the entry is removed from the state tables... however I
might
add that as far as I can see this opens up another interesting bug in
firewall-1,
which could lead to the possibility of a man in the middle attack, though
further
details will follow about that in another post.

Because this does NOT work in a NAT configuration, in theory, although
this hasnt been tested, the work around would be to map all global ips on
your external interface, and then static nat the ports you want accessible
on your DMZ through to localnet ip addresses.
