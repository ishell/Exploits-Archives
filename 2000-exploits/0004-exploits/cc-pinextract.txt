          Vendor Status: Vendor contacted - response and precautions are 
                             shown below
                  Web: http://www.L0pht.com/advisories.html
                     

Overview:

        CRYPTOCard's (http://www.cryptocard.com) CRYPTOAdmin software is a
user authentication administration system which uses various hardware and
software token devices for challenge/response. Using the user's PIN number
("what you know") and the token ("what you have"), the correct response
will be calculated based on the challenge prompted from the CRYPTOAdmin
server.

        The PT-1 token, which runs on a PalmOS device, generates the 
one-time-password response. A PalmOS .PDB file is created by the
CRYPTOAdmin software for each user. The .PDB file is loaded onto the Palm
device. The user name, serial number, key, and PIN number are all stored 
in this file in either encrypted or plaintext form. By gaining access to 
the .PDB file, the legitimate user's PIN can be determined through a 
series of DES decrypts-and-compares.

        Having both the .PDB and the PIN number will allow an attacker to 
clone the token on another Palm device and generate the proper responses 
given the challenge from the CRYPTOAdmin server. Using the demonstration
tool below, the PIN can be determined in under 5 minutes on a Pentium 
III 450MHz.


Detailed Description:

        The PalmOS PT-1 application requires the user to enter their PIN
number before the challenge/response information is granted. If the 
.PDB file of the legitimate users gets into the hands of an attacker, 
they will easily be able to extract the legitimate PIN using the 
demonstration tool below.

        The PalmOS platform is inherently insecure and was not designed 
for security-related applications. Any application and database 
information can be accessed and modified by any other application. In 
the past, tokens used to generate one-time-passwords were often 
tamper-evident hardware devices. These devices are difficult to 
reverse-engineer and will sometimes erase critical information if
tampering is detected. The software token, such as the PT-1 Palm token, 
allows the functionality of a previously secure device to be executed 
on an insecure platform. Methods to determine program operation is much 
easier in this fashion, making the software tokens less secure and 
causing a weak link in the security chain.

        The .PDB file, containing the critical information, can be accessed 
from either the user's desktop PC or Palm device. PalmOS HotSync often 
stores a copy of the application, once sync'ed to the Palm, in the 
/Palm/<user>/Backup directory. If a new .PDB file is pending for sync to 
the Palm, it is stored in the /Palm/<user>/Install directory. 

        If an attacker has temporary access to the user's Palm, they can 
transfer the .PDB file to their own Palm device using the PalmOS "Beam" 
functionality. CRYPTOCard intentionally prevents the beaming of their 
database by setting the PalmOS lock bit, but using BeamCrack, a L0pht 
Heavy Industries tool, the lock bit can be removed and the database 
can be beamed. 

        The information we need from the .PDB, which is an 8-byte 
ciphertext string, is located from address $BD to $C4. Simply open the 
.PDB file in a hex editor to extract the bytes. 

        The DES key is generated based on the entered PIN number and a 
fixed 4-byte value, $247E 3E6C. If the administrator issues PINs with 
less than 8 digits, the PIN is padded up to 8 digits with 45678 (i.e. 
if PIN is 9999, it will be padded to be 99995678) before the DES key is 
generated. 

        If the entered PIN is correct, the DES decrypt will output a 
plaintext of $636A 2A3F 256D 676C. If the entered PIN is incorrect, 
the plaintext output will be different, since the key used to decrypt 
the information was incorrect.

        ciphertext from .PDB -> DES Decrypt -> plaintext known
                                            ^
                                            |
                        key = (entered PIN) w/ fixed value

        An example PIN authentication routine is as follows:

        1) Ciphertext from .PDB = $11FB 32C3 80EE 9318
        2) Entered PIN number * 9 = 26745678 * 9 = $0E58 F5BE
        3) Key = $0E58 F5BE 247E 3E6C
        4) DES decrypt -> plaintext = $636A 2A3F 256D 676C
        5) If plaintext = $636A 2A3F 256D 676C, PIN is good!

        By creating a key based on each possible 8-digit PIN, ranging 
from 00000000 to 99999999, and performing decrypt-and-compare, the 
PIN can be brute-forced in a trivial amount of time. On a Pentium III
450MHz running Windows NT 4.0, the 100,000,000 PIN attempts can be 
completed in under 5 minutes.


Temporary Solution:

        The quick solution, although it does not remedy the core problem, 
is to confirm that the .PDB file is not stored on the user's desktop 
machine after it has been loaded onto the PalmOS device. A global find 
for *.PDB will enable you to find all .PDB files on the user's machine. 
It is highly recommended that extreme caution is taken to prevent 
compromise of the .PDB files. 

        Changing the PIN numbers on a daily or weekly basis is also 
recommended. 

        A longer term solution, especially if the PT-1 tokens are already 
deployed, would be to move to a tamper-evident hardware token, such as 
the CRYPTOCard RB-1 or KF-1 devices. These physical pieces of hardware 
are much more secure, due to the fact that they are dedicated to one 
function and it is more difficult to extract the PIN information from 
the devices. 

Vendor Response:

        CRYPTOCard Corporation and Tony Walker, VP of Development, were 
extremely responsive to our advisory submission. Their friendliness,
quick response, and action plan is greatly appreciated and should be
commended. What follows is the exact response to our submission.

> 3.  Most importantly, be very careful about the physical security of
> your Palm Pilot. Don't leave it where someone else might access it.  
> Once an attacker has access to your Palm Pilot, perhaps only for a 
> few minutes, the security of your token is compromised.

> The point about physical security cannot be overemphasized.  Any

> Having said all that, there are always ways to improve.  The next
> release of the Palm Pilot token software will not store the PDB file
