    Lo and behold, yet another "grab EGID mail on a Slack exploit"

    Almost a complete waste of valuable CPU time to execute...
    What is more questionable is who is maintaining the Elm package
    at this time, since this isn't just the second overflow I have
    seen in it and it probably won't be the last...

    Hope you all have a good time trying to read other people's mail
    (not that you can being EGID mail on most Slackware boxes, but hey :)

    Use as: filterape [offset] [EGID mail]
            Now you get nothing - use ^D to grab shell

    Cheers,
