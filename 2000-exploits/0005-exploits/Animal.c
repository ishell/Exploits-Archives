The Gauntlet exploit is real.  Below I will include proof of concept code.
Since this exploit exists, it gives me new fear that there is probably more
to come.  Security verdors need to pay better attention to the code they put
out.  Pix, Checkpoint, Gauntlet, all have exploits that came out this year.
Whats wrong with this picture??!

So here it is, script kiddies don't bother, this code wont help you.  It is
written to run a test file called /bin/zz (Gee, think I just made a quick
change to a shell code)  anyway, just throw a file called zz in /bin on the
gauntlet firewall and chmod it to 700.  Inside the zz file you should have
it do something where it will leave you a log.  Here is a real simple
example.

#!/bin/sh
echo "IT RAN" > /tmp/TEST

Simple enough eh?

* Script kiddies can go away, this will only execute a file

* make a file named /bin/zz and chmod it to 700.
* I suggest for the test you just have the zz file make a note
* in syslog or whatever makes you happy.

* This code is intened for proof of concept only.
