        Synnergy Laboratories Advisory SLA-2000-17

NAME

       Anaconda Foundation Directory NULL byte vulnerability

AFFECTED
 
        Linux/UNIX with Anaconda Foundation Directory

SYNOPSIS

 Synnergy Labs has found a flaw within Anaconda Foundation Directory that allow
s a user to 
 successfully traverse the filesystem on a remote host, allowing arbitary files
/folders to 
 be read.


DESCRIPTION 

 The Anaconda Foundation Directory is a Yahoo style search engine based on the 
Open Directory 
 project, www.dmoz.org. The Anaconda Foundation Directory allows you to dynamic
ally integrate content into 
 your site's own look and feel. This is the exact same content that Lycos featu
res on their 
 front page! Product pricing is $499 US.

 Anaconda Foundation Directory can be found at:http://anacondapartners.com/ap_a
fodpdemo.shtml

 Synnergy has recently discovered a flaw within Anaconda Foundation Directory t
hat allows a remote 
 user to traverse the filesystem as a request to the script using the $template
=_some_file_. It is 
 then possible to read any file contents with priviledges as the httpd.
 Although the script checks for the file extension (.htm, .html, .shtml, .stm) 
adding a trailing 
 %00.html, (a NULL byte in URL encoded format), at the end of the request will 
force the script to 
 open the file.

 Example: 

 http://www.target.com/cgi-bin/apexec.pl?etype=odp&template=../../../../../../.
./../../etc/resolv.conf%00.html&passurl=/category/
 

 The above line if given will output the file contents of /etc/resolv.conf.

SOLUTION

  The vendors have been informed of the bug. It is advised to wait for the next
 patched version of 
  Anaconda Foundation Directory to be released.
