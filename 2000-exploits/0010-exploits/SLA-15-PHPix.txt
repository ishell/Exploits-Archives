        Synnergy Laboratories Advisory SLA-2000-15

NAME

       PHPix 1.0.X directory traversal vulnerability

AFFECTED
 
	Linux/UNIX with PHPix 1.0.0/1.0.1/1.0.2

SYNOPSIS

 Synnergy Labs has found a flaw within PHPix that allows a user to successfully 
 traverse the filesystem on a remote host, allowing arbitary files/folders to be 
 read.


DESCRIPTION 

 PHPix is a Web-based photo album viewer written in PHP. It features automatic
 generation of thumbnails and different resolution files for viewing on the fly.
 PHPix Photo Album is available from http://phpix.org

 Synnergy has recently discovered a flaw within PHPix that allow a remote user to 
 traverse a directory as a request to the script using the
 $mode=album&album=_some_dir_variable. It is then possible to read any file
 or folder's contents with priviledges as the httpd.

 Example: 

 http://target.com/Album/?mode=album&album=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc&dispsize=640&start=0

 The above line if given will output all the directories that are nested within /etc 
 directory. Other more sinister content can be revealed from there.


SOLUTION

  The vendors have been informed of the bug. It is advised to wait for the next patched
  version of PHPix to be reelased.
