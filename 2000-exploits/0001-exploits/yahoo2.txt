    Jaynus Jaynus  found following.   He read  over the  ICQ  overflow
    that had been found so he was curious if this existed in any other
    clients.   Upon  testing  the  below  URL,  yahoo  pager/messenger
    crashed in the same was as ICQ.

    Just a quick little find, so  the guess is that it should  be easy
    to push the  stack in an  exploitable direction, but  for the time
    being, it can be used as just a simple DoS attack.

    Nothing yet.
