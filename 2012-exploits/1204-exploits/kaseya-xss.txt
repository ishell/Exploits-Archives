1. Summary

The Kaseya version 6.2.0.0 web interface (and possibly other versions) is
vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in the "adminName" variable.

2. Description

By submitting malicious input such as the following, it is possible to
render javascript in the security context of the Kaseya server:

"><sCrIpT>alert(83212)</sCrIpT>

3. Proof of Concept

Use a HTML proxy such as WebScarab or Burp to intercept the HTML form post
as it is submitted, and replace the "adminName" with the input above.

4. Impact

Arbitrary JavaScript code may be executed in the security context of the
Kaseya web server.

5. Affected Products

"System Version 6.2.0.0" (from information pane of affected web server)
and possibly others.


6. Solution

Upgrade to the latest version.  According to Kaseya, "The fix was actually
deployed with hotfix #1686, Files Released to VSAUpdate, batch 499 on
1/30/2012 6:16:06 PM"
