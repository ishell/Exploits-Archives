Introduction:
=============
The United States Department of Education, also referred to as ED or the ED for (the) Education 
Department, is a Cabinet-level department of the United States government. Recreated by the 
Department of Education Organization Act (Public Law 96-88) and signed into law by President Jimmy 
Carter on October 17, 1979, it began operating on May 16, 1980. The Department of Education 
Organization Act divided the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare into the Department of 
Education and the Department of Health and Human Services. The Department of Education is administered 
by the United States Secretary of Education. It is by far the smallest Cabinet-level department, with 
about 5,000 employees. The agency s official acronym is ED (and not DOE, which refers to the United 
States Department of Energy). It is also often abbreviated informally as DoED.
