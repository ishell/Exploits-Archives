Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
A Buffer Overflow vulnerability is detected on Crystal Office Suite v1.43 (current version). Vulnerable are all included 
programs: CellPro, ChartPro, ClipPlus, NotePro.

The vulnerability is located in each of the program executeables. An oversized string on the registry values  Recent1, Recent2 
etc. within the keys: 

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Crystal Office/CellPro]  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Crystal Office/ChartPro]  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Crystal Office/ClipPlus]  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Crystal Office/NotePro]  

Results in a local buffer overflow. The value is read while opening the file menu. An attacker needs to manipulate the registry 
value and has to trick the victim to hover over the ReOpen menu item within the  File menu.
