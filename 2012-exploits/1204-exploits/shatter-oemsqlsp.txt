Details:
SQL Injection works by attempting to modify the parameters passed to an

SQL injection can be used to insert additional SQL statements to be
executed.

/em/console/ecm/search/searchPage is vulnerable to SQL Injection
attacks. This web page is part of Oracle Enterprise Manager web

statements with the elevated privileges of the SYSMAN database user in
the repository database. This user has the DBA role granted.

Impact:
This vulnerability allows an Oracle Enterprise Manager user to execute
SQL statements with the elevated privileges of the SYSMAN database user.
This may also be exploited by an attacker that convinces a valid user to
click or open a malicious link.
