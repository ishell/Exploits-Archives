Introduction:
=============
Matterdaddy Market is a application that allows you to run your own online marketplace or classifieds 
listing site similar to Craigslist. It was written in PHP and uses MySQL to for data storage. Additionally, 
it uses jQuery for elegant effects and that web 2.0 pizzazz you ve always dreamed of.

The general design is simple and clean which should go well with any site, customization can be done easily 
through the CSS file. You can add your header and footer to it or include it in an iframe and you are ready 
to roll. And if you want to get your hands dirty in code, the comments will help you know what is going on.

- PHP
- MySQL (4 or 5)
- GD Library to support images

Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:

High


Details:
========
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability is detected on Matterdaddys Market eCommerce Content Management System v1.1.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
					      [+] Controller -  cat_order=   &  cat_name=

The sql injection vulnerability can only be exploited by privileged user accounts without required user inter action. 
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.
server.com/mdmarket/admin/controller.php?cat_name=1&cat_order=-1%27[SQL INJECTION]
&add=Add+Category&op=newCategory

2.
server.com/mdmarket/admin/controller.php?cat_name=-1%27[SQL INJECTION]
&cat_order=1&add=Add+Category&op=newCategory


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerabilities is estimated as high(-).
