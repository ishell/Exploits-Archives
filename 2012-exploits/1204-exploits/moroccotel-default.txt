Hi,

a "vulnerability" was identified on MoroccoTel Boxes:
a telnet server is running, open to the web, with a default password of
admin (or 123456)

This critical vulnerability can affect the entire network of a Country.

Solution: change the default password account or modify the default firmware

NB: a new firmware was released, introducing a cipher on the "PPOE
password" (one common, publicly available PPOE account is largely used)

Discovered by NETpeas research team, NETpeas CERT is trying to contact
the ISP

More details:
