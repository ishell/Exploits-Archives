Introduction:
=============
ManageEngine® Firewall Analyzer is a web based tool for change management, configuration analysis, security audit 
of Firewall devices, bandwidth monitoring and security reporting. The software application analyzes the Firewall 
devices configurations, manages the configuration changes and audits security of devices. It collects, analyzes, 
and archives logs from network perimeter security devices and generates reports. The devices are, Firewalls, 
Proxy servers, Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), and Virtual Private Networks 
(VPN) (see complete list of devices supported). The salient features of the application are Firewall device 
management, bandwidth monitoring and security reports.

Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Lab Team discovered mutliple non persistent Cross Site  Vulnerabilities on Manage Engines Firewall Analyzer v7.2


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-02-13:	Vendor Notification
2012-04-01:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
Manage Engine
Product: Firewall Analyzer v7.2


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Low


Details:
========
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected on the ME Firewall Analyzer v7.2 Application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required 
user inter action or local low privileged user account. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing 
& client-side content request manipulation.
