Introduction:
=============
Start your own Flash web game website. Search engine optimized. Embed your Adsense etc code. 5 star AJAX rating system. 
True full-screen toggle for the players. Unlimited category organization. Quick and easy to add games! This game site is easy 
enough that inexperienced users will be able to create their game site from start to finish (just install and add content 
using the visual editor and without knowing any HTML). Yet powerful and customizable enough that experienced 
webmasters and programmers will appreciate both time saved and streamlined organization features which will make 
management of their game site easy down the road.

Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in the idev GameSite v1.0 Content Management System.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-08:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
1.1
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability is detected on Game Website Script :: idev-GameSite 1.0
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] index.php?page=pages&id=
					[+] admin/index.php?page=addpage&id=
					[+] admin/index.php?page=categories&catid=

1.2
A persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in Game Website Script :: idev-GameSite 1.0
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) 
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action.
                                       
Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] Create Image - Title/Caption


Proof of Concept:
=================
The sql injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without required user inter action.
The persistent vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with medium required user inter action. 
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1
http://127.0.0.1/gamesite/index.php?page=pages&id=1[sqli]
http://127.0.0.1/gamesite/admin/index.php?page=addpage&id=1[SQLi]
http://127.0.0.1/gamesite/admin/index.php?page=categories&catid=1[SQLi]

1.2
he issue can be exploited by an insert on the Created Object function with script code as value.
The result is the persistent execution out of the web application context.

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the pre auth sql injection vulnerability is estimated as critical.

1.2
The security risk of the persisten input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium.
