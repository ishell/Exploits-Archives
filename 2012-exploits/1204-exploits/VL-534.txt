Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in Pritlog v0.821 Content Management System.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-29:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Pritlog v0.821 Content Management System. The bugs 
allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). Successful exploitation 
of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires 
low user inter action. Attackers can inject malicious strings as author name to execute them when an admin is processing to preview, review 
or manage the listing of users. The bug is located on application side & the execution is persistent out of the user management web 
application context.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Manage User Listing - Username & Author
