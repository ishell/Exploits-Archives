    Ajax file manager with upload and auto-thumbnailing for images
    Ajax gallery system
    Post priviledges - every post can be configured to be seen by only guests, administrators, members etc
    Ratings and comments can be enabled or disabled on a per post basis
    Spam protection - configurable time-outs for disallowing posts within a certain time from visiting site and 
	from last post made etc, also online post checking with TypePad AntiSpam
    Advanced theme templating system means you can change the look of your site with a single click, and

Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in EmbryoCore v1.03.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-14:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability (POST) is detected in EmbryoCore v1.03 content management system.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.
The vulnerability is located on the username post method.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Add User or Register User Request (POST) [embryocore/index.php?event=admin:auser]


--- SQL Exception Logs ---
<div style=``display: none; opacity: 1;`` id=``kmessage`` class=``no-display``><img src=``

You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server 
version for the right syntax to use near ``=> ``></div>

1.2
A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in the EmbryoCore v1.03 web application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) 
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action because the admin needs to watch the user list.
The user includes his scriptcode as profile name and the code is getting executed on the administrator section 
persistent.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Profil & Username Input Field
				  [-] Admin Control Panel - User Listing 


Picture(s):

Proof of Concept:
=================
The sql injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without inter action or local low 
privileged user accounts. For demonstration or reproduce ...


1.1
To inject the sql command implement your statement on the user input fields and send it with the request (POST Method).
The return will be the error or successful query of the application dbms.

POST:	/embryocore/index.php?ajax=admin:auser&mode=createNewUser HTTP/1.1
POC: 	user_displayname=[SQL-INJECTION]&user_login=test2&user_email=m@dot.empire&user_password=123456&user_cpassword=hack4best


1.2
The persistent input validation vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without inter action 
or local low privileged 
user accounts. Successful exploitation requires low user inter action because the admin only have to review the user listing. 
For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability via post method is estimated as high(-).

1.2
The security risk of the persistent vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).
