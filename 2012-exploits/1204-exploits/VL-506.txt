Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability is detected on Netjukes v1.0 RC1 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.
The vulnerability is located on the search module of the web application.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                                           [+] search.php


Proof of Concept:
