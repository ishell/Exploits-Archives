A client side cross site scripting vulnerability is detected on DirectAdmins Management Web-Application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker with privileged user account to hijack customer/moderator/admin sessions with high required user inter 
action. Successful exploitation can result in account steal or client side context manipulation when processing affected module
application requests.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                      [+] CMD DOMAIN - &domain=
