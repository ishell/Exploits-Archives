Introduction:
=============
Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA) (NASDAQ: EA) is a major American developer, marketer, publisher and distributor of video games.
Founded and incorporated on May 28, 1982 by Trip Hawkins, the company was a pioneer of the early home computer games industry
and was notable for promoting the designers and programmers responsible for its games. It is one of the largest video game
publishers in the world.
Originally, EA was a home computing game publisher. In the late 1980s, the company began developing games in-house and supported
consoles by the early 1990s. EA later grew via acquisition of several successful developers. By the early 2000s, EA had become
one of the world`s largest third-party publishers. On May 4, 2011, EA reported $3.8 billion in revenues for the fiscal year
ending March 2011. EA began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular
online gaming site Pogo.com in 2001. In 2009, EA acquired the London-based social gaming startup Playfish, and in June 2011,
EA launched Origin, an online service to sell downloadable games directly to consumers. In July 2011, EA announced that it
had acquired PopCap Games, the company behind hits such as Plants vs. Zombies and Bejeweled.
