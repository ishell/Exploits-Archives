Attach some PoC analysis related to a XSS vulnerability to phpldapadmin. I previously coordinate with the Cert-US in order they contact with Sourceforge and Debian, but receive they was unable to put in contact with them.

The first discover was on January 10 for 1.1.6 version, where after noticed that the same vulnerability was discover previously. For that reason I tested later for version 1.2.2 (sourceforge) and 1.2.0.5 (Debian package).
More reference: see the files attached

On January 24 I contacted to sourceforge and appear they fix the package but still persistence on debian packages.

Fix from sourceforge:
