1. OVERVIEW

The CubeCart 3.0.20 and lower versions are vulnerable to Open URL Redirection.


2. BACKGROUND

CubeCart is an "out of the box" ecommerce shopping cart software
solution which has been written to run on servers that have PHP &
MySQL support. With CubeCart you can quickly setup a powerful online
store which can be used to sell digital or tangible products to new
and existing customers all over the world.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

The CubeCart 3.0.20 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a
remote cross site redirection attack. This flaw exists because the
application does not properly sanitise the parameters,"goto" and "r".
This allows an attacker to create a specially crafted URL, that if
clicked, would redirect a victim from the intended legitimate web site
(domain.com) to an arbitrary web site (localhost) of the attacker's
choice.
