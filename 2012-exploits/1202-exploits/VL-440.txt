Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
A remote SQL Injection Vulnerability is detected on the Facebook NYClubs application (apps.facebook).
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) to inject/execute own sql statements on the affected fb application dbms.
Successful exploitation can result in a stable application, service or dbms compromise.

Vulnerable Application(s): 
			                            [+] NYClubs - Facebook 3rd Party Application

Vulnerable Module(s): 
			                            [+] Messagebox


Affected Service(s): 
			                            [+] apps.facebook.com/nyclubs/


--- Exception/Error Logs ---
INSERT INTO reviews (club_id, ip, name, fbid, location, email, rating, content, active, approved) VALUES (652,`121.112.203.222 `

1.2
A client side Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability is detected on the Facebook NYClubs application (apps.facebook).
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) to hijack sessions & manipulate client-side application requests with 
high required user inter action.

Vulnerable Module(s): 
			                            [+] ?r=sregion&d=

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited with & without high required user inter action. For demonstration or 

reproduce ...

1.1
Vulnerable:	[MessageBox Input] ---> Include a frame to the local app website & extract the error log

Tables: 	club_id, ip, name, fbid, location, email, rating, content, active, approved
IP:		121.112.203.222
NAME:		Sven R-m
Mail:		x014831@gmail.com
Limit:		10--
Type:		Order by Injection
