Introduction:
=============
Macro Toolworks is powerful all-in-one Windows automation macro software. It allows user to record macros, 
visually edit macros and playback macros in any Windows application. Each macro can be triggered multiple ways 
depending on the user s  needs: by keyboard shortcuts, mouse clicks or other events, macro scheduler, hotkey, 
toolbars, etc. Macros recorded in macro recorder (both keyboard recorder and mouse recorder) can be manually 
edited and optimized. Macros can simply mimic user by sending Windows keys and mouse clicks or they can do even 
more complex repetitive daily tasks such as file backups and other file manipulation, fill web forms, e-mail 
writing, chatting, inserting data to database forms, files downloading/uploading, file and directory zipping 
and encryption and more ...

Severity:

High


Details:
========
A Buffer Overflow vulnerability is detected on Pitrinecs Software Macro Toolworks Free/Standard/Pro v7.5.0 Edition (current version). 
The vulnerability is located in the main executeable _prog.exe, which gets invoked e.g. by 
the _loader.exe or by StartMacroToolworks.exe. When launching the _prog.exe or one executeable 
which invokes the _prog.exe, it automatically reads the contents of the options.ini from the 
application directory. It reads the [last] section string to determine which files have been 
opened at last by the user. The application does validate the string length of the [last] section 
before passing the content to a buffer, which could lead to a local buffer overflow.
