Disclosure Timeline

Reported to vendor on 1 Mar 2012.
Response from vendor:
Disclosure of the path is not considered a security risk.
Drupal has a configuration setting which allows PHP warnings to be printed to the screen for debugging purposes... For production websites, it is a good idea to turn this off, and the messages will not be displayed.
==============
Comments

Unfortunately for them, many sites display errors in production.
