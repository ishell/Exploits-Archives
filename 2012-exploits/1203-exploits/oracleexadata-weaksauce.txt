Oracle Exadata Infiniband Switch default logins and world readable shadow file

Hi Full-Disclosure List,

I've noticed a minor issue with the 1/4 rack Oracle Exadata Solution.

What is Exadata?

From Oracle.com "Oracle Exadata is the only database machine that provides extreme performance for both data warehousing and OLTP
applications, making it the ideal platform for consolidating on private clouds. It is a complete package of servers, storage, networking,
and software that is massively scalable, secure, and redundant. With Oracle Exadata customers can reduce IT costs through consolidation,
store up to ten times more data, improve performance of all applications, deliver a faster time-to-market by eliminating systems integration 
trial and error, and make better business decisions in real time."

The oracle engineered solution contains two leaf switches and in larger installations a spine switch.  The installation I worked with didn't
have a spine switch, but the two leaf switches were configured with three logins with easily guessable passwords and a shadow file
that was world readable.

There are three accounts with easily guessable default passwords on the 
exadata inifiniband switches:

 ilom-admin, ilom-operator and nm2user.

rux0r:~ meep0$ ssh ilom-admin@192.168.0.113 "cat /conf/shadow"

The shadow file is world readable:

[root@exad-1swib2 ~]# ls -l /conf/shadow
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 749 Dec 23  2011 /conf/shado


Vendor: notified 3/12/2012

Fix: 

Rotate default passwords. I am checking on if you can lock down file permissions on /conf/shadow with out causing issues.
