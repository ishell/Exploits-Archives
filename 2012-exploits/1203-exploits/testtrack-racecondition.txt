Software:

releases, TestTrack helps you deliver quality products on time.

[..]


Problem:

In the Linux Installation of Testtrack, there is an Init-Script
called spls, that "suffers" from a race condition.


Details:

Race in pidofproc()
splicsrv
Init file for Seapine License Server

[..]

OSNAME=`uname -s`  <-- deep into uname skills :p

[..]

   # function to find the pid of a program
   pidofproc() {
        base=`basename $1`
#       removed pidof command for awk script that parse ps output - MJT
#        pid=`pidof -o $$ -o $PPID -o %PPID -x ${base}`
        ps -ef > /tmp/ps.tbl
        pid=`awk -F" " '/\/splicsvr/ {print $2}' /tmp/ps.tbl`
        rm -rf /tmp/ps.tbl > /dev/null 2>&1
        if [ "$pid" != "" ]
        then
            echo $pid
            return 0
        fi
    }

Vendor Communication:

20 Feb -- notified.
20 Mar -- No response after 30 days -> "disclosed"


Misc Notes:

I also tried to kill arbitrary pids, but someone was so clever to match
them in /proc instead of killing them.

In the end, the sofware seems not activly maintained.


Greetings:

To CVE Team for being uncomplicated.
To pancake for being nice.
To srm, Dude! don't drink so much.
To those, who trust me.
To all who stay real.
