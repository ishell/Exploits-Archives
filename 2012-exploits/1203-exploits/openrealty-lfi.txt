1. OVERVIEW

Open-Realty 2.5.8 and lower versions are vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.


2. BACKGROUND

Open-Realty is the world's leading real estate listing marketing and
management CMS application, and has enjoyed being the real estate web
site software of choice for professional web site developers since
2002.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

Open-Realty contains a flaw that may allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary commands or code. The issue is due to the
'index.php' script not properly sanitizing user input, specifically
directory traversal style attacks (e.g., ../../) supplied to the
'select_users_template' parameter. This may allow an attacker to
include a file from the targeted host that contains arbitrary commands
or code that will be executed by the vulnerable script. Such attacks
are limited due to the script only calling files already on the target
host. In addition, this flaw can potentially be used to disclose the
contents of any file on the system accessible by the web server.
