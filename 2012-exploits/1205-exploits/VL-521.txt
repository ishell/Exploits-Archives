Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in GetSimple CMS v3.1.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-16:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in GetSimple v3.1 Content Management System.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) 
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action. The bug is located on the email & permalink 
input fields of the application websettings.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Website Settings - Email
				[+] Website Settings - Custom Permalink Structure

1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in GetSimple v3.1 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required 
user inter action or local low privileged user account. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing 
& client-side content request manipulation.

Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with low or medium required
user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
