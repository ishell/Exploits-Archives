===========
Description
===========
Symantec pcAnywhere Version 12.5 and below is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability. A flaw exists in the authentication component listening on TCP port 5631 which does not sufficiently validate user-submitted data. 

=================
Technical Details
=================

It is possible to supply an invalid login that causes heap corruption and an object pointer overwrite. We end up in with a reliable overwrite of EAX as detailed below:

mov ECX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]    
mov EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[ECX+8]
push EAX
call EDX

A reliable overwrite in (non-rebasing/ASLR DLLs) of a fully patched Windows XP SP3 was found such that remote command execution can be gained.

As the service restarts indefinitely, a reliable exploit in Windows 7 was also developed which effectively brute-forces a valid address to bypass ASLR.
