backupDB() v1.2.7a (onlyDB) Remote XSS Vulnerability


Vendor: SiliSoftware
Product web page: http://www.silisoftware.com
Affected version: 1.2.7a-201108021626

Summary: backupDB() is a PHP script that backs up MySQL tables and
databases to a file (uncompressed, gzip, bzip2) for easy daily backup.

Desc: backupDB is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly
sanitize user-supplied input to the 'onlyDB' parameter of the
'backupDB.php' script. Attackers can exploit this weakness to
execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 (EN)
           Apache 2.2.21
           PHP 5.3.8
           MySQL 5.5.20
