   H!

   NEC Corp. has a product line of high perfomance servers
   - http://www.nec.com.sg/index.php?q=products/enterprise-servers

   In the documentations it is said that there is two user privilege
   levels:

   1. Common user - who can monitor the system status

   2. Admin user - for configuring system hardware

   but there is another very high privilege user, who can manipulate
   memory and produce hardware falure.
