## Details

Atlassian Confluence is described as "Collaboration tool for teams to
create, share, and discuss rich content - docs, files, ideas, specs,
diagrams, mockups, anything". (www.atlassian.com)


## Description

A security vulnerability within Atlassian Confluence Wiki has been
identified. It is remotely exploitable and based on the CWE-79 family
Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS). Confluence allows input passed in the URL to
be injected into the HTML structure of an error-page in an unsafe and
unsanitized way. Therefore it is possible to inject nonpersistent
JavasScript code. This vulnerability does not require authentication of
the victim and can easily be exploited by manipulating the GET request.


## Proof of Concept

The following URL triggers the XSS by including <IFRAME
SRC="javascript:alert('XSS')"> into the error page:

http://localhost:8090/pages/includes/
status-list-mo%3CIFRAME%20SRC%3D%22javascript%3Aalert%28%27XSS%27%29%22%3E.vm


## Solution

According to the vendor, upgrade to Confluence 4.1.9 or later.
