-----------------

A generic parameter on the /_admin/index.php page was found to be subject to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Impact
======

An attacker might entice users to follow a malicious URL, or visit a malicious page that submits arbitrary code to a Microcart application. If they do so, Javascript code might execute in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or downloading malware onto their machine.


Solution
========

The affected product is not under active development and, at the time of writing, no patch has been released by the vendor.
