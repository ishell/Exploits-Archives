Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher of the Vulnerability Laboratory Team discovered multiple web vulnerabilties in eFront v3.6.11 Educational.

Affected Products:
==================
eFront
Product: Educational v3.6.11


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the eFront Educational v3.6.11 Content Management System.
The vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
The first vulnerability is located in the profile module with the bound vulnerable firstname & lastname parameters. The bug 
allows a low privileged student account to exploit higher privileged trainer or administrator user accounts via registration.
Exploitation of the first vulnerability requires low privileged student elearning application user account.
The secound vulnerability is located in the Messages - New Folder Name module with the bound vulnerable folder listing.
Exploitation of the secound vulnerability requires low privileged student user account & is only local exploitable.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities can lead to persistent session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable 
(persistent) context manipulation. 


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Profile - User (Administrator User Listing)
				[+] Messages


Vulnerable Parameters(s):
				[+] Firstname & Lastname
				[+] Foldername


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with a privileged student account.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent web vulnerabilities are estimated as high(-).
