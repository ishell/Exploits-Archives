*Summary*

A Clickjacking vulnerability existed on Linkedin that allowed an attacker
to add or delete a secondary email and can also make existing secondary
email as primary email by redressing the manage email page.

*Details*

Linkedin manage email page (a total of 1 page) was lacking X-FRAME-OPTIONS
in Headers and Frame-busting javascript  measures to prevent framing of the
pages. So the manage email page could be redressed to 'click-jack' Linkedin
users. Below I have mentioned the vulnerable Url.
