Description:
Python Interpreter is a native python development application for the iPad/iPhone. It is available for iOS 4 and above.

The product is packaged with its own httpd and ftpd servers. Enabling the local daemons for development by Touching Computer<->This Machine starts up an httpd server and ftpd server, both daemons are bound to device IP not localhost.

Vulnerabilities:

httpd server allows upload of arbitrary files to root WWW directory.

Browsing to http://<target_ip>:8080/ presents an index page in which anyone can upload files to the web servers root directory.

ftp server vulnerable to ../ bug

The ftp server doesn't sanitize user input and allows remote users to read and possibly write to the devices storage.

ftp://192.168.0.24:10000/../../../../../../../private/etc/passwd

The ftp server doesn't bother authenticating users, any username/password combination will allow you in.
