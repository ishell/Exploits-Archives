Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Better WP security v3.4.3 Wordpress Application Addon.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high required user inter 
action. The bugs are located on server side in the Limit Login Attempts, Exception Handling Error & Intrusion Detection module with the 
bound vulnerable email address & error parameter. Successful exploitation can result in wordpress application account steal, client side 
phishing & client-side content request manipulation. Exploitation requires medium or high user inter action & without privileged 
web application user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Better WP Security - Limit Login Attempts & Intrusion Detection
				[+] Exception Handling Error

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Email Address
				[+] Error


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action & low privileged 
application user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Inject the following example string to the application input (persistent) or parameter (client side)
String:  >"<iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com></iframe>

<div id="message" class="error"><p>\"><[PERSISTENT INJECTED SCRIPT CODE!]")' <="" is="" 
not="" a="" valid="" ip.<="" p=""></div>


Solution:
