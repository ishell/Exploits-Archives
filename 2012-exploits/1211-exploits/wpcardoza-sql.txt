AJAX Post Search wordpress plugin description
This plugin will allow your website visitors to search the posts of your site without page refresh.
##########################
SQL (blind) injection description
The problem was located in :cardoza_ajax_search.php file, to be more specific  the_search_function() . I could see that the srch_txt field hadn't been sanitized.

POC:

/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php/?srch_txt='or 1=1-- &action=the_search_text

via ajax

it is possible to access the database and as a consequence  get user information such as usernames, passwords among other data
