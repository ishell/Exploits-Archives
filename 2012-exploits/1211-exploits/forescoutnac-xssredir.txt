Forescout NAC ICMP and ARP Protocols Not Filtered Vulnerability Advisory (CVE-2012-4985)

Forescout NAC (Network Access Control) device is vulnerable to ICMP and ARP protocol filter bypass. The NAC does not filter traffic from unknown clients over these protocols.

The attacker could then use these credentials via an authorised terminal/workstation to gain full access to the network.
