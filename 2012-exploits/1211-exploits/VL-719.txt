Introduction:
=============
Skype is a proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol service and software application originally created in 2003 by Swedish entrepreneur 
Niklas Zennström and his Danish partner Janus Friis. It has been owned by Microsoft since 2011. The service allows users to communicate 
with peers by voice, video, and instant messaging over the Internet. Phone calls may be placed to recipients on the traditional telephone 
networks. Calls to other users within the Skype service are free of charge, while calls to landline telephones and mobile phones are charged 
via a debit-based user account system. Skype has also become popular for its additional features, including file transfer, and videoconferencing. 
Competitors include SIP and H.323-based services, such as Linphone, as well as the Google Talk service, Mumble and Hall.com.

Skype has 663 million registered users as of September 2011. The network is operated by Microsoft, which has its Skype division headquarters 
in Luxembourg. Most of the development team and 44% of the overall employees of the division are situated in Tallinn and Tartu, Estonia.

Unlike most other VoIP services, Skype is a hybrid peer-to-peer and client–server system. It makes use of background processing on computers 
running Skype software. Skype`s original proposed name (Sky Peer-to-Peer) reflects this fact. Some network administrators have banned Skype 
on corporate, government, home, and education networks, citing reasons such as inappropriate usage of resources, excessive bandwidth usage, 
and security concerns.

Details:
========
A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in the official Skype Community Website Application.
The vulnerability is located in the update post form with the unsanitized username in send mails.
Attackers can inject malicious persistent script code on application side of the skype skype community.
The vulnerability is located in the filter function of the username when skype community is processing 
to send a not parsed update mail. Remote attacker with low privileged application user accounts can change 
the username values to malicious persistent script code via POST. The result in a persistent script code 
inject via noreply@skype.net. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in persistent phishing 
attacks, persistent session hijacking or mail context manipulation via persistent inject.
