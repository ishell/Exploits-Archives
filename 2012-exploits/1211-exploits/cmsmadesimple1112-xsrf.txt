Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in CMS Made Simple, which can be exploited to perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.


1. Сross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in CMS Made Simple: CVE-2012-5450

The application allows authorized administrator to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without making proper validity checks to verify the source of the requests. This can be exploited to delete arbitrary files and directories.

An attacker should make logged-in administrator open a malicious link in the browser to exploit this vulnerability.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) code will delete the root directory with all files leading to complete destroy of the CMS:

http://[host]/lib/filemanager/imagemanager/images.php?deld=../../
<img src="http://[host]/lib/filemanager/imagemanager/images.php?deld=../../" width=1 height=1>

Successful exploitation requires that user under which the web server is running has write access to files or directories to delete.

Solution:

Upgrade to CMSMS 1.11.2.1
