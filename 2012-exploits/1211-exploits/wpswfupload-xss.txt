Hello list!

I will draw your attention to XSS vulnerability in swfupload in WordPress.

In April there was announced Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in 
swfupload.swf in WordPress (CVE-2012-3414). It was fixed in WordPress 3.3.2. 
At that time there was no detailed information about it.

Last week I've noticed, that people begun disclosing this XSS hole in 
swfupload.swf in other web applications (as in one WP plugin, where I found 
it). So the details of this hole was already disclosed, which leaded to new 
advisories with XSS in this flash file in other webapps.

After that I've made research and here is information about different 
versions of this swf-file (with different names) and all versions of 
WordPress, which contain any of these swf-files. I.e. not one swf (mentioned 
by Neal Poole), but two swf's with different names have this XSS.

This hole was found by Neal Poole and Nathan Partlan. And at 17.05.2012 Neal 
have disclosed it at his site 
(https://nealpoole.com/blog/2012/05/xss-and-csrf-via-swf-applets-swfupload-plupload/). 
Details about all affected versions of WordPress and versions of swf-file 
are provided bellow.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are versions WordPress 2.5 - 3.3.1.

File swfupload.swf is bundled with WordPress 2.7 - 3.3.1.

File swfupload_f9.swf is bundled with WordPress 2.5 - 2.7.1.

In versions WP 2.7 - 2.7.1 both flash-files are contained.

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-includes/js/swfupload/swfupload.swf?movieName=%22]);}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie);//

WordPress 2.7-3.3.1.

http://site/wp-includes/js/swfupload/swfupload_f9.swf?movieName=%22]);}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie);//

WordPress 2.5-2.7.1.

At 20.04.2012 this vulnerability was fixed in WordPress 3.3.2. The 
developers of WordPress released new version of flash file, which could be 
used by all web developers, which were using swfupload.

Swfupload is used in WordPress, plugins for WP and in other web 
applications. There are many web applications with it, not as many as those 
which are using JW Player (http://securityvulns.com/docs28176.html) and JW 
Player Pro (http://securityvulns.com/docs28483.html) (vulnerabilities in 
them I've disclosed earlier), but still a lot of. And in the next letter 
I'll present a set of such web applications.
