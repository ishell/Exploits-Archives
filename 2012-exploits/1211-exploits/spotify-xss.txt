Introduction:
=============
Spotify is a Swedish music streaming service offering digitally restricted
streaming of selected music from a range of major and independent record
labels, including Sony, EMI, Warner Music Group and Universal. Launched in
October 2008 by Swedish startup Spotify AB, the service had approximately
ten million users as of 15 September 2010, about 2.5 million of whom were
paying members. Total users reached 15 million by August 2012, 4 million
of them paying monthly. As of November 2012, the service is available in
Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland,
France, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco,
the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the
United Kingdom and the United States.

The system is currently accessible using Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X,
Linux, Telia Digital-tv, iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, Windows
Phone, S60 (Symbian), webOS, Squeezebox, Boxee, Sonos, WD TV and MeeGo.

Music can be browsed by artist, album, record label, genre or playlist as
well as by direct searches. On desktop clients, a link allows the listener
to purchase selected material via partner retailers.

A six month free trial period is activated upon Spotify account
registration or first login with a Facebook account, where a user can
listen to an unlimited amount of music supported by visual and radio-style
advertising. After the trial, Spotify has a listening limit of 10 hours
per month, divided into a 2.5 hour streaming allocation each week (with
any unused hours carrying over to the next week). An "Unlimited"
subscription removes advertisements and time limits and a "Premium"
subscription introduces extra features such as higher bitrate streaming,
offline access to music and mobile app access. An active Facebook account
is required to use Spotify if the user has signed up using Facebook, but
as of 30 August 2012 the option to make a Spotify username has been
reintroduced. Subscriptions are restricted to people with credit/debit
cards or PayPal accounts registered in certain countries.
