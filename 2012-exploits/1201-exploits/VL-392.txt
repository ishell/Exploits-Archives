Introduction:
=============
Parallels H-Sphere delivers a multi-server hosting automation solution for Linux, BSD, and Windows platforms. 
H-Sphere includes its own controls panels, automated billing, and provisioning solution in a single integrated 
system. It is scalable to any number of boxes — more Web, mail, database, and Windows hosting servers can be 
added without downtime.



Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory researcher discovered multiple persistant cross site scripting vulnerabilities on Parallels H-Sphere 3.3 Patch1.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-01-22: Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistant cross site scripting vulnerabilities where detected on Parallels H-Sphere 3.3 Patch1.
These vulnerabilities allow an remote attacker to hijack customer sessions via persistent cross site scripting.
Successful exploitation can result in account steal, client side exploitation or phishing & session hijacking.
These bugs are located on the admin panel of Parallels H-Sphere 3.3 Patch1.

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with high account privileges(mod/admin) & required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

[Poc 1]

Open Link: http://demo.psoft.net/psoft/servlet/psoft.hsphere.CP/admin/1_0/psoft.hsphere.CP?template_name=admin/group_plans.html

choose admin
post xss on Group Name: <IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME> press add group. Result XSS!

[Poc 2]
Open link: http://demo.psoft.net/psoft/servlet/psoft.hsphere.CP/admin/1_0/psoft.hsphere.CP?template_name=admin/extra_packs/create_extra_pack.html
Extra Pack Name put xss code: <IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME>
Extra Package Prices set fee 1 recurrent fee 1 just click submit you will see result.



Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistant cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(-).
