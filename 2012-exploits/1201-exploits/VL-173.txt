Affected Products:
==================

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
Multiple SQl-Injection vulnerabilities are detected on the DUS INT Airport Website & Services.
The remote vulnerability allows an remote attacker to execute own sql commands on the vulnerable value or module.
Successful exploitation of the remote SQL Injection vulnerabilities can result in access to all db tables, read server/root passwords, 
access to sensitive information like customer creditcards/bonuscards, identity-listings, flight-number, schedules, tickets, IDs, 
packetnumbers, flightfields, pins, ccs, cvs, emails & company/business details.
