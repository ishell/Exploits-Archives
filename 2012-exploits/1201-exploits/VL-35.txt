Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent Input Validation vulnerabilities are detected on Barracudas SSL VPN 480. Local low privileged user account can
implement/inject malicious persistent script code. When exploited by an authenticated user, the identified vulnerabilities 
can lead to information disclosure, access to intranet available servers, manipulated persistent content.
