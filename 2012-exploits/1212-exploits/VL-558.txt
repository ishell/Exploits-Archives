Introduction:
=============
Targeting large enterprises the FortiDB-2000B appliance provides scalable database security and 
compliance solution. Utilizing its flexible policy framework, the FortiDB-2000B allows quick and 
easy implementation of internal IT control frameworks for database activity monitoring (DAM/DAA), 
IT audit, and regulatory compliance.

Designed for mid-sized enterprises, the FortiDB-1000C appliance provides a comprehensive database 
security and compliance solution. Through its web-based interface, the FortiDB-1000C centrally 
monitors, audits and scans multiple distributed, heterogeneous databases. This ensures consistent 
database security policies across the organization without imposing high management burdens on your 
database admin and IT staff. 

The FortiDB-400B appliance provides a cost effective database security and compliance solution for 
small to mid-size enterprises in a quick to implement, easy to manage package. It scans databases 
for vulnerabilities, monitors, and audits databases activities, and generates compliance reports. 
Its intuitive web-based interface ensures ease of configuration, minimizing the management burden 
on your database administrators and IT staff.

Product: FortiDB  - Database Security Appliance v2000B; 1000C & 400B


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
A non-persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in FortiGates FortiDB Appliance 2000B 1000C & 400B. 
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). 
The vulnerability is located in the Java Number Format Exception Handling module with the bound vulnerable output listing. 
The bug is on application side & the execution is non-persistent out of the object exception-handling web application 
appliance context. Exploitation requires low or medium user inter action. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can 
lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. 

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Java Number Format Exception Handling

Affected Function(s):
				[+] (Output) Listing


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker with medium or high required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
