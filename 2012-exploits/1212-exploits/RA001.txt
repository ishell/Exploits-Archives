             RA001: Multiple vulnerabilities in Ncentral versions
8.0.x - 8.2.0-1152
             -----------------------------------------------------------------------

RA001-1a: Insecure SOAP access leads to unprivileged SSH session
----------------------------------------------------------
The Remote Desktop Support feature of Ncentral is enabled by default.
The normal manner of use is as follows:

1. A customer browses to the front page, clicks the Start Session
button and fills in his or her details.
2. Provided a  user is logged into N-central with remote availability
enabled, the customer is prompted to
   download an EXE.
2. They then download the remote support agent EXE and run it.
3. The agent communicates with n-central over SOAP and sets up an SSH
session for tunneling the actual remote
   support session.

If an attacker spoofs the SOAP messages sent by the agent EXE, he or
she will be offered a SSH username and private
key that can then be used to gain an unprivileged SSH session on the
ncentral server itself. While the account
cannot interact with the system (shell is set to /bin/false), by using
SSH tunneling the attacker can target
services that would not normally be accessible due to firewalling,
such as the database service.

RA001-1b: PostgresQL Trust based authentication for localhost leads to
database compromise
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the SSH credentials gained in 1a. above, an attacker can create
a SSH tunnel between his or her local machine
and the Ncentral server's PostgreSQL instance by using the arguments
-L 5432:127.0.0.1:5432. The attacker can then
connect his or her own psql client to the ncentral server"s database
by using the command:

$ psql -U postgres -d mickey -h localhost

As the connection is trusted (due to the origin being localhost), the
attacker gains superuser privileges on the
ncentral database. He or she can then acquire the hashed user account
passwords by selecting all rows from the
"luser" table (see below), or reset a password/create a new account
with SO admin privilege by using the
update/insert commands. However such an attack does not immediately
lead to escalation due to the use of a custom
database connection pool and in memory cache ("DMS").

RA001-1b-1: Unsalted passwords can potentially lead to superuser compromise
---------------------------------------------------------------------

It was noted that the "luser" table stores user passwords in an
unsalted form. A well equipped attacker
may be able to brute force the unsalted password hashes for one of the
superuser accounts.

RA001-1c: Plain text password storage for the openfire user leads to
root compromise
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the database connection gained in 1b above, an attacker can
acquire the admin password for the openfire
service by selecting from the "xmpp" table. The password is stored in
plain text. Using the SSH connection from 1a,
the attacker can access the openfire admin console running on port
9090 of the ncentral server.

By logging in as the openfire "admin" user, an attacker can upload a
malicious plugin into the openfire service,
leading to a root shell compromise on the ncentral server. This can
then be used to flush the "luser" table in the
DMS service, which will update the passwords in memory allowing the
attacker to login to the NCUI with SO Admin
privileges, allowing him or her to make wide ranging changes to the
configuration of Ncentral.

RA001-2: Insecure backup URLs can lead to remote root/SO compromise
-------------------------------------------------------------

An insecure URL access vulnerability exists in the NAC allowing an
unauthenticated user to download the system
backup tarball. By default, the system will back up every night at
00:15, making a tarball available for download at
the URL

https://ncentral:10000/admin/ncbackup-YYYYMMDDHHMM-daily.tar

where YYYYMMDDHHMM is the date and time when the backup process
completed. By taking yesterday's date and iterating
the hour and minute values from 0000, an attacker can download the
system backup tarball without providing any
credentials.

The system backup tarball, among other things, contains a complete
database dump and the system shadow file. An
attacker could brute force the hashes in the database dump (see 1b-1
above), or attack the system shadow hashes and
potentially gain a privileged SSH account on the system.

3: Cross site request forgery via the NCUI can lead to SO Admin compromise
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main web UI is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. By luring a logged in
SO Admin level user to a URL with the following
malicious image tag embedded:

<img src="https://ncentral/addAccountActionStep1.do?page=1&pageName=add_account&email=test%40redacted.co.nz
&pswd=CSRF123!!!&confirmPassword=CSRF123!!&paperSize=Letter&numberFormat=en_US&statusEnabled=true&type=SO%20Admin
&defaultDashboard=All%20Devices&uiSessionTimeOut=20&configRemoteControlEnabled=on&useRemoteControlEnabled=on
&rcAvailability=Available&useManagementTaskEnabled=on&firstName=CSRF&lastName=Hacker&phone=&ext=&department=
&street1=&street2=&city=&stateProv=&postalCode=&country=&method=Finish"></img>

an attacker can create his or her own SO level user in the system,
with no additional interaction from the
admin required.
