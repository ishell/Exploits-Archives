Introduction:
=============
VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW) is a company providing virtualization software, founded in 1998 and based in Palo Alto, 
California, USA. The company was acquired by EMC Corporation in 2004, and operates as a separate software subsidiary.
VMware s desktop software runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, while VMware s enterprise software hypervisors 
for servers, VMware ESX and VMware ESXi, are bare-metal embedded hypervisors that run directly on server hardware without 
requiring an additional underlying operating system.

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected on the VMware vendor website service application. 
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker to hijack customer sessions with low required user inter action. 
The vulnerability is located in the username and profil input fields and the output display listings.
Successful exploitation can result in account steal or execution of malicious persistent context.

Vulnerable Module(s):
						[+] Profil

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
						[+] Username, Welcome & Title

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action.

Solution:
=========
To fix the vulnerability parse the input field when processing to save profile content.
Sanitize the output listing of the user profile and title were the context is getting executed.
Restrict the input field also with a char mask or secure filter as exception-handling.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as high(-).
