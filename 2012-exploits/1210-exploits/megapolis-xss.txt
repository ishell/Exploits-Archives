Megapolis.Portal Manager.

It's commercial CMS from Softline-IT (earlier Softline), which in 
particularly widespread among Ukrainian government sites (including 
ministry, parliament, two special services and many other web sites). In 
previous years I already wrote about multiple vulnerabilities in 
Megapolis.Portal Manager. These particular vulnerabilities were found at web 
sites of ministry and parliament.

2010.07.16 - developers answered, that they don't care about these holes 
(and so about all web sites on their CMS) and will not fix them.

decline the support of the government sites for which they were paid.
