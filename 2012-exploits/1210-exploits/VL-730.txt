Abstract:
=========
The Security Effect Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in the VaM Shop v1.69 web application cms.

High


Details:
========
1.1
A laboratory researcher discovered a critical sql injection vulnerability in the VaM Shop v1.69 web application content management system.
The sql vulnerability allow remote attackers to inject/execute own sql commands/statements on the affected VaM Shop v1.69 web application 
dbms. The vulnerability is located in the shopping_cart.php files with the bound vulnerable products_id parameter request. The vulnerability 
can be exploited by remote attackers without required user inter action. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in web application
dbms and service compromise or stable application manipulation via sql injection.

Vulnerable Files(s):
				[+] shopping_cart.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] products_id


1.2
A laboratory researcher discovered a client side Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability in the VaM Shop v1.69 web application content management system.
The vulnerability is located in the advanced_search_result.php file when processing to load script code out of the search results web context. 
Successful exploitation results in session hijacking, non -persistent account phishing or client side content manipulation.

Vulnerable Files(s):
				[+] advanced_search_result.php


Proof of Concept:
=================
1. Blind SQL injection in shopping_cart.php in parameter product_id[]. 
The SQL Injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC: POST  - SQL INJECTION

/shopping_cart.php
?action=update_product
cart_delete[]=2071&cart_quantity[]=1&old_qty[]=1&products_id[]=2071'[SQL INJECTION VULNERABILITY] and sleep(37)%3d%27

 
2. Multiple Cross Site Scripting
The client side cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with medium or high required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
/advanced_search_result.php/o" onmouseover=prompt(document.cookie) //
/shopping_cart.php?action=update_product > cart_delete[]=o" onmouseover=prompt(document.cookie) //


Risk:
=====
1.
The security risk of the blind sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high(+).

2.
The security risk of the client side cross site scripting vulnerability is estimated as low(+).
