Overview
===============
DartWebserver.Dll is an HTTP server provided by Dart Comunications
(dart.com). It is distributed intheir PowerTCP/Webserver For ActiveX
product and likely other similar products.

"Build web applications in any familiar software development
environment. Use WebServer for ActiveX to add web-based access to
traditional compiled applications."

Version 1.9 and prior is vulnerable to a stack overflow exception,
these maybe generated by producing large requests to the application,
e.g. "a" * 5200000 + "\n\n"

Analysis
===============
During the processing of incoming HTTP requests the server collects
data until it encounters a "\n\n" sentinel. If the request is large,
multiple copies are made and stored on the stack, this consumes the
amount of stack space available to the process quickly, leading to a
stack overflow exception being thrown. This exception is not handled
and will typically lead to the termination of the parent process. Some
variations may exist per system depending on pre-existing memory
conditions and modification of Proof Of Concept (PoC) code may be
necessary to reproduce the exception.
