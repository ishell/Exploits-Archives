Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web  Vulnerabilities in Interspire Email Marketer 6.0.1, Email Marketing Software. 


Report-Timeline:

Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
Interspire
Product: Email Marketer v6.0.1


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
1.1
A SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in the Interspire Email Marketer v6.0.1, Email Marketing Software.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to execute a SQL commands 
on the affected application dbms. The sql injection vulnerability is located in dynamiccontenttags file with 
the bound vulnerable id parameter. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application 
compromise. Exploitation requires no user interaction & without privileged user account.

Vulnerable File(s):
			[+] index.php

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] ID

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] dynamiccontenttags


1.2
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Interspire Email Marketer v6.0.1, Email Marketing Software. 
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). The persistent 
vulnerabilities are located in the user account, user groups, contacts, email campaigns or recent activity module with the bound 
vulnerable fullname, groupname, email, content block name and activitylog parameters. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability 
can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter 
action & privileged web application user account.


Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] Users&Groups ->  Create a user account
			[+] Users&Groups ->  Create a user group
			[+] Contacts -> Add contact
			[+] Email Campaigns -> Dynamic Content Tags -> Create a Dynamic Content Tag
			[+] Recent Activity


Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] Full Name 
			[+] Group Name
			[+] Email Address
			[+] Content Block name
			[+] All recent activities get executed in the recent activity box 


1.3
A non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected in the Interspire Email Marketer v6.0.1, Email Marketing Software.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high required 
user inter action or local low privileged user account. The vulnerability is located in the dynamiccontenttags module with the 
bound vulnerable action parameter. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in account steal, client site phishing 
or client-side content request manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] dynamiccontenttags

Vulnerable File(s):
			[+] admin/index.php?Page=Addons&Addon=dynamiccontenttags

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] Action


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Addons&Addon=dynamiccontenttags&
Action=Edit&id=-1%27+UNION+Select+1,2,3,4--%20-

http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Addons&Addon=dynamiccontenttags&
Action=Edit&id=-1%27+UNION+Select+1,version%28%29,3,4--%20-


1.2
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low or medium required user inter action 
& low privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...


1.2.1
The attacker can create a user with injecting a malicious code i.e., 
>"<iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com onload=alert("VL")</iframe>, in the field Full name. 
When the admin views the users the code gets executed. The attacker also can change his full name in the settings 
and whenever the admin checks the user list, the code gets executed 

URL: http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Users&Action=Add


1.2.2
The attacker can Create a User group and inject a malicious code in the Group name. Whenever the victim lists the user groups, 
the code gets executed in the victim browser.

URL: http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=UsersGroups&Action=createGroup

1.2.3
The attacker can inject a malicious code in the server side by adding a contact. The attacker goes to Contacts -> add contact 
and then try to inject a malicious code in the email field. An error message will pop up that the email is invalid. To bypass, 
this message, the attacker creates a normal user with any email i.e., test@test.com. After creating the user, the attacker edit 
the user and change the email to the malicious code. The error message will not show up and the code will get executed for any 
user who will list the contacts. 

URL: http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Subscribers&Action=View&List=7&id=5019
URL: http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Subscribers&Action=Add


1.2.4
The attacker can inject a malicious code in the server side by creating a content block from Dynamic content tags section. 
The field "block name" is vulnerable. Whenver the victim views the blocks the code gets Executed.

URL: http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Addons&Addon=dynamiccontenttags&Action=edit

1.2.5
Finally, Any of the activities gets logged in the recent activity module that gets showed in every screen in the web app. 
If the attacker done with persistent malicious attacks any of the previous malicious actions the code will get executed 
again in the recent activity module.

1.3
PoC:
http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Addons&Addon=
dynamiccontenttags&Action=%3E%22%3Ciframe%20src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com%20onload=alert%28%22VL%22%29%3C/iframe%3E



Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the remote SQL Injection vulnerability is estimated as critical.

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).

1.3
The security risk of the client side cross site scripting vulnerability is estimated as low(+).
