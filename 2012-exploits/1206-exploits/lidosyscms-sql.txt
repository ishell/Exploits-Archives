Hello list!

CMS.

These are SQL Injection and Information Leakage vulnerabilities.

Vulnerable are all versions of the system, except the last one, which was
released by developers after my informing. Where they've fixed these
vulnerabilities in their CMS. But there are a lot of other vulnerabilities
in this CMS.

SQL Injection (WASC-19):

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

Leakage of a log of DB requests errors. It can be used for getting 
information about DB structure and at conducting of SQL Injection attacks 
(because error messages aren't shown at pages of a site).
