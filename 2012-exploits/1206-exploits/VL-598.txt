Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher Team discovered multiple local File Include Vulnerabilities in different Webify 
web products like eDownloads Cart, eDownloads, Project Manager or the Webify Blog.

Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple local File Include vulnerabilities are detected in different Webify web products like eDownloads Cart, 
eDownloads, Project Manager or the Webify Blog. The vulnerability allows an attacker to request local system or 
application files. The vulnerability is located in the page=  value request of the admin & index file. Successful 
exploitation result in dbms or service/appliance compromise via file include (exp. web shell upload). 
The same vulnerable structure has been implemented to different products series of webify like eDownloads Cart, eDownloads, 
Project Manager or Webify Blog.


Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] Webify eDownloads Cart
				[+] Webify eDownloads
				[+] Webify Project Manager
				[+] Webify Blog

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] index.php
				[+] admin/index.php


Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] ?page=



1.2
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in different Webify web products like eDownloads Cart, 
eDownloads, Project Manager or the Webify Blog. The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code 
on the application side (persistent). Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) 
or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged user account. The persistent 
vulnerabilities are located in index.php with the bound values addobjects, formdesigner & query.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] Webify eDownloads Cart
				[+] Webify eDownloads
				[+] Webify Project Manager
				[+] Webify Blog


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] query
				[+] addobjects
				[+] formdesigner
				[+] Comments - Text, Name & Topic
				[+] Submission - Text & Name


Vulnerable Input(s):
				[+] Topic
				[+] Objectname
				[+] Label
				[+] Comments Text & Nanem
				[+] Submissions Name


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The file include vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user accounts & without 
required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
	../index.php?page=[LOCAL FILE INCLUDE]
	../admin/index.php?page=[LOCAL FILE INCLUDE]


1.2
The persistent web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user accounts but with low 
required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
	../admin/index.php?page=query [Persistent Script Code Inject via Query Value]
	../admin/index.php?page=addobjects [Persistent Script Code Inject via addObject name Value]
	../admin/index.php?page=formdesigner  [Persistent Script Code Inject via former label Value]
	../admin/index.php?page=comments [Persistent Script Code Inject via Comment text & name Value]
	../admin/index.php?page=submissions [Persistent Script Code Inject via submission name Value]


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the local file include are estimated as medium(+).

1.2
The security risk of the  persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estiamted as medium.
