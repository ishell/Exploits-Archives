Hello list!

After previous vulnerabilities in plugin Organizer, I'll present five more 
security vulnerabilities in plugin Organizer for WordPress. This is the 
fourth in series of advisories concerning vulnerabilities in this plugin.

These are Directory Traversal, Cross-Site Scripting and Full path disclosure 
vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Organizer 1.2.1 and previous versions.

As answered me the developer of the plugin, he doesn't support it anymore 
and will not be fixing any vulnerabilities in it.

Details:
----------

Directory Traversal (WASC-33):

http://site/wp-admin/wp-admin/admin.php?page=organizer/page/view.php

In the fields "Rename File to" and "Copy File As" it's possible to set 
relative paths (for moving or copying of the files in arbitrary directories, 
including for replacing of existent files).

XSS (WASC-08):

POST request at page 
http://site/wp-admin/admin.php?page=organizer/page/dir.php
"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
In the fields dirname and newdirname.

As I've mentioned in previous advisory, the script dir.php are vulnerable to 
CSRF, which simplify conducting of these XSS attacks.

FPD (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-admin/admin.php?page=organizer/page/users.php

If for all roles (in the field "User") settings are made (in the list "User 
Setting"), then in body of web page the error message are showing with full 
path at the server.
