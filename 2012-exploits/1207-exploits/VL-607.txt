Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities  are detected in the Funeral Script PHP Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected application dbms without user inter action. The vulnerabilities are located in the funeral_script.php 
& admin.php files and the bound vulnerable parameters orderBy, orderType & hide_cat. Successful exploitation of the 
vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise. 

Vulnerable File(s):
			[+] admin.php
			[+] preview.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] orderBy
			[+] orderType


1.2
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Funeral Script PHP Content Management System.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). 
The vulnerabilities are located in the 

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) 
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged application user account.


Vulnerable Section(s): 
			[+] Event - Input & Listing
			[+] Calender - Input & Listing

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] [Calender - Name|Title > Listing]
			[+] [Event - Name|Title > Listing]


Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] newCal - name
			[+] newEvent - title




1.3
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected on the ME Firewall Analyzer v7.2 Application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high 
required user inter action or local low privileged user account. Exploitation requires low user inter action or low 
privileged application user account. The bugs are located in the admin.php & funeral_script.php files with the bound 
vulnreable parameters orderBy, search, orderType, p, hide_cat & obit_id. Successful exploitation can result in account 
steal, phishing & client-side content request manipulation.

Vulnerable File(s):
			[+] admin.php
			[+] preview.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] cal_id, cal_month & cal_year
			[+] act
			[+] search


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user accounts & without required
user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

http://127.0.0.1:80/eventcalendar/admin.php?act=calendars&orderType=DESC&search=&orderBy=-1%27[SQL-INJECTION]cal_name&cal_id=2
http://127.0.0.1:80/eventcalendar/admin.php?act=calendars&orderType=-1%27[SQL-INJECTION]&search=&orderBy=cal_name&cal_id=2
http://127.0.0.1:80/eventcalendar/admin.php?act=events&orderType=ASC-1%27[SQL-INJECTION]&orderBy=event_title&cal_id=2
http://127.0.0.1:80/eventcalendar/admin.php?act=events&orderType=ASC&orderBy=-1%27[SQL-INJECTION]event_title&cal_id=2
http://127.0.0.1:80/preview.php?act=calendars&orderType=DESC&search=&orderBy=-1%27[SQL-INJECTION]cal_name&cal_id=2



1.2
The persistent script code inject vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user acctount & 
low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
http://127.0.0.1:80/eventcalendar/admin.php?act=newCal&cal_id=2
http://127.0.0.1:80/eventcalendar/admin.php?act=newEvent&cal_id=2

Note: Inject your persistent script code to the title input fields and watch the vulnerable output listing.



1.3
The client side cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with medium or high required user
inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
http://127.0.0.1:80/eventcalendar/preview.php?cal_id=%22%3E%3Ciframe%20src=a%20onload=alert%28%22VL%22%29%20%3C&cal_month=1&cal_year=0#oncal
http://127.0.0.1:80/eventcalendar/preview.php?cal_id=2&cal_month=%22%3E%3Ciframe%20src=a%20onload=alert%28%22VL%22%29%20%3C&cal_year=0#oncal
http://127.0.0.1:80/eventcalendar/preview.php?cal_id=2&cal_month=1&cal_year=%22%3E%3Ciframe%20src=a%20onload=alert%28%22VL%22%29%20%3C#oncal
http://127.0.0.1:80/eventcalendar/admin.php?act=%22%3E%3Ciframe%20src=a%20onload=alert%28%22VL%22%29%20%3C


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated as high(+).

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estiamted as medium(-).

1.3
The security risk of the non-persistent cross  site scripting vulnerabilities are estiamted as medium(-).
