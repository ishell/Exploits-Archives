Introduction:
=============
At your request and for a reasonable price, we may add or change features on the Funeral Script PHP. Funeral Script PHP 
requires PHP 4.3 or higher and MySQL 3 or higher to run on your server. Please make sure that your webserver meet 
this PHP / MySQL requirements.

Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple different web vulnerabilites in Funeral Script PHP.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-06-17:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities  are detected in the Funeral Script PHP Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected application dbms without user inter action. The vulnerabilities are located in the funeral_script.php 
& admin.php files and the bound vulnerable parameters orderBy, orderType & hide_cat. Successful exploitation of the 
vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise. 

Vulnerable File(s):
			[+] admin.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] orderBy
			[+] orderType
			[+] hide_cat



1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in the Funeral Script PHP Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high 
required user inter action or local low privileged user account. Exploitation requires low user inter action or low 
privileged application user account. The bugs are located in the admin.php & funeral_script.php files with the bound 
vulnreable parameters orderBy, search, orderType, p, hide_cat & obit_id. Successful exploitation can result in account 
steal, phishing & client-side content request manipulation.

Vulnerable File(s):
			[+] admin.php
			[+] funeral_script.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] orderBy
			[+] search
			[+] orderType
			[+] obit_id
			[+] p
			[+] hide_cat


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged application user account & without
required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

http://127.0.0.1:80/37/funeralscript/admin.php?act=obituaries&orderType=[SQL-INJECTION]


1.2
The non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with medium or high required 
user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:

http://127.0.0.1:80/37/funeralscript/admin.php?act=comments&obit_id=-1%[Cross Site Scripting]


http://127.0.0.1:80/37/funeral_script.php?id=1&p=[Cross Site Scripting]%3C&search=[Cross Site Scripting]
http://127.0.0.1:80/37/funeral_script.php?hide_cat=[Cross Site Scripting]


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated as high(+).

1.2
The security risk of the non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estiamted as low(+).
