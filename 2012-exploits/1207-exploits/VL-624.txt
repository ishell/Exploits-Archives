Introduction:
=============
Simple Machines Forum — SMF in short — is a free, professional grade software package that allows you to set up 
your own online community within minutes. Its powerful custom made template engine puts you in full control of 
the layout of your message board and with our unique SSI - or Server Side Includes - function you can let your 
forum and your website interact with each other. SMF is written in the popular language PHP and uses a MySQL database. 
It is designed to provide you with all the features you need from a bulletin board while having an absolute minimal 
impact on the resources of the server. SMF is the next generation of forum software - and best of all it is and 
will always remain completely free!

Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the official SMF v2.0.2 (Board|Forum Application) CMS.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). The persistent 
vulnerabilities are located in the package manager, smiley sets, newsletter and edit members or groups with the vulnerable bound
post parameters local path url, username, url, emails & title. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged application 
user account. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (admin/mod/user) or stable (persistent) 
manipulation of the web application context.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                          [+] Local path to SMF & Username [Packages]
                          [+] URL
                          [+] Name of emails
                          [+] Name & Group Title


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent input validation vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker with local low privileged user account & low required 
user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
