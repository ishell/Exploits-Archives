Vulnerability discovered:

User Account Enumeration and User Account Information Disclosure

Vulnerability impact:

Low - Remote user accounts can be ascertained, and then possibly used
to further gain access to valid credentials.

Vulnerability information:

Most information in Squiz Matrix CMS, including users, are stored as
entites called "assets". This includes user accounts. By enumerating
all assets, it is possible to determine if the asset is a user account
by viewing the web page of a given asset by looking for the asset name
prepended by a "~" character. Furthermore, if a valid user account
asset is found, under most conditions tested, it is possible to
disclose
the user's account's full name/description by looking at the user's
asset offset by -2.
