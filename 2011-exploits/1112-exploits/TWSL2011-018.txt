Finding: Authentication Bypass (Web Management Console)
CVE: CVE-2011-1372

The IBM TS3200/TS3200 Web User Interface is vulnerable to an authentication
bypass attack. By sending a series of requests to the authentication
function, it is possible to trigger a condition which causes the
application to grant an access cookie which permits remote administration.

Repeated queries using the following HTTP query arguments provided
administrative access to the appliance after several tries:

user_level=3&password=aaaaaaaaaaa&login=Log+in'

The password is not believed to be significant. Once access is granted,
the following cookies are set on the client's browser:

Cookie: RMU_LEVEL=3; RMU_LOGIN=9999


Remediation Steps:
Update firmware version to A.60 or above.
