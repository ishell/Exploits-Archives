Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in OBM, which can be exploited to perform information disclosure, cross-site scripting, local file inclusion and SQL injection attacks.

1) Input passed via the "module" GET parameter to /exportcsv/exportcsv_index.php is not properly verified before being used to include files. 
This can be exploited to include local files via directory traversal sequences.

The following PoC is available:

http://[host]/exportcsv/exportcsv_index.php?action=export_page&module=../../../../tmp/file

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in.

2) Input passed via the "sel_domain_id" POST parameter to /obm.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:


<form action="http://[host]/obm.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="login" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="password" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="sel_domain_id" value="' SQL_CODE_HERE">
<input type="submit" value="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>


Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.

3) Input passed via the "lang", "theme" GET parameters to /settings/settings_index.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/settings/settings_index.php?lang=%27%20SQL_CODE_HERE
http://obm/settings/settings_index.php?theme=%27%20SQL_CODE_HERE

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in, as well as "magic_quotes_gpc" to be disabled. 

4) Input passed via the "tf_user" GET parameter to /group/group_index.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/group/group_index.php?action=search&popup=&sel_privacy=_ALL_&submit=Find&tf_user=%27%20SQL_CODE_HERE

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in, as well as "magic_quotes_gpc" to be disabled. 

5) Input passed via the "tf_delegation", "tf_ip", "tf_name" GET parameters to /host/host_index.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerabilities requires attacker to be registered and logged-in, as well as "magic_quotes_gpc" to be disabled. 

6) Input passed via the "action" GET parameter to obm.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/obm.php?action=%27%20SQL_CODE_HERE

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in, as well as "magic_quotes_gpc" to be disabled. 

7) Input passed via the "cal_alert", "cal_first_hour", "cal_interval", "cal_last_hour", "commentorder", "csv_sep", "date", "date_upd", "debug_exe", "debug_id", "debug_param", "debug_sess", "debug_solr", "debug_sql", "dsrc", "menu", "rows", "sel_display_days", "timeformat", "timezone", "todo" GET parameters to /settings/settings_index.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/settings/settings_index.php?cal_alert=%27%20SQL_CODE_HERE&cal_first_hour=0&cal_interval=4&cal_last_hour=1&commentorder=0&csv_sep=%3b&date=Y-m-d&date_upd=Y-m-d&debug_exe=16&debug_id=1&debug_param=2&debug_sess=4&debug_solr=32&debug_sql=8&display=yes&dsrc=0&form_user_pref=1&mail=yes&mail_participation=yes&menu=text&public_fb=yes&rows=10&sel_display_days=1111111&submit=Validate&timeformat=12H&timezone=Africa%2fAbidjan&todo=todo_priority

8) Input passed via the "tf_delegation", "tf_ip", "tf_name" GET parameters to /host/host_index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/host/host_index.php?action=search&cb_backup_ftp=1&cb_imap=1&cb_imap_frontend=1&cb_monitor=1&cb_obm_sync=1&cb_smtp_in=1&cb_smtp_out=1&cb_solr=1&popup=&submit=Find&tf_delegation=%22%20onmouseover=alert%28document.cookie%29;%22&tf_ip=&tf_name=

9) Input passed via the "login" POST parameter to /obm.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.


<form action="http://[host]/obm.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="login" value='" onmouseover=alert(document.cookie) "'>
<input type="hidden" name="password" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="sel_domain_id" value="">
<input type="submit" value="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>


10) Input passed via the "tf_user" GET parameter to /group/group_index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.

11) The "test.php" script is stored with insecure permissions inside of the web root. 
This can be exploited to get potentially sensitive information (e.g. PHP configuration details) by calling the file directly. 

The following PoC code is available:
