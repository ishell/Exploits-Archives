Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in PHPShop CMS Free, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting, sql injection attacks.

1) Input appended to the URL after multiple files is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/phpshop/admpanel/banner/adm_baner_new.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/phpshop/admpanel/gbook/adm_gbook_new.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/phpshop/admpanel/links/adm_links_new.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/phpshop/admpanel/menu/adm_menu_new.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/gbook/?a=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of this vulnerabilities requires that Apache's directive "AcceptPathInfo" is set to "on" or "default" (default value is "default") 

2) Input passed via the "pid" GET parameter to /phpshop/admpanel/catalog/admin_cat_content.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/phpshop/admpanel/catalog/admin_cat_content.php?pid=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

3) Input passed via the "id" GET parameter to /phpshop/admpanel/catalog/adm_catalog_new.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/phpshop/admpanel/catalog/adm_catalog_new.php?id=%%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

4) Input passed via the "catalogID" GET parameter to /phpshop/admpanel/page/adm_pages_new.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.
