[Bug Summary]
-  Asp source code disclosure
[Impact]
- High
[Affected Version]
- Version:5.10.014
[Bug Description and Proof of Concept]
Attackers use source code disclosure attacks to try to obtain the
source code of server-side applications. The basic role of Web servers
is to serve files as requested by clients. Files can be static, such
as image and HTML files, or dynamic, such as ASP, JSP and PHP files.
When the browser requests a dynamic file, the Web server first
executes the file and then returns the result to the browser. Hence,
dynamic files are actually code executed on the Web server.

source code.
