Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple new vulnerabilities in plugin Register 
Plus Redux for WordPress. Last version of the plugin was checked.

These are Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection, Code Execution and Full path 
disclosure vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Register Plus Redux v3.7.3.1 and previous versions.

By request of my client I've made new version of the plugin with fixing of 
all vulnerabilities, which I found. I named this version as Register Plus 
Redux 3.8 (to distinguish between it and original version of the plugin). So 
all users of this plugin can find new and secure version of the plugin in 
Internet.

Details:
----------

XSS (WASC-08):

POST request at page http://site/wp-login.php?action=register
</textarea><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
In field About Yourself.

By using function Autocomplete URL it's possible to conduct attack via GET:

http://site/wp-login.php?action=register&description=%3C/textarea%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

At plugin options page the protection against CSRF is used, so it needs to 
use reflected XSS for bypassing it and conducting of persistent XSS and 
persistent SQL Injection attacks.

Persistent XSS (WASC-08):

At set option "Show Invitation Code Tracking widget on Dashboard" in plugin 
settings and adding invitation code (Add a new invitation code), it's 
possible to set JS/VBS code.
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

Which will work at page Dashboard (http://site/wp-admin/index.php).

Persistent SQL Injection (WASC-19):

At set option "Show Invitation Code Tracking widget on Dashboard" in plugin 
settings and adding invitation code (Add a new invitation code), it's 
possible to set for SQL Injection.
' and benchmark(1000000,md5(now())) and 1='1

Which will work at visiting of the page Dashboard 
(http://site/wp-admin/index.php). This is Persistent Blind SQL Injection 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/2751/).

Code Execution (WASC-31):

If to have access to plugin settings, it's possible to conduct Code 
Execution via field Custom Logo URL via uploading of 1.phtml.jpg. It's 
depends of version of the engine, which I've wrote about in post Code 
Execution in WordPress 2.5 - 3.1.1 (http://websecurity.com.ua/5108/). This 
attack will work in versions of engine before WordPress 3.1.3, where 
developers fixed upload functionality (which is used by the plugin).

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/register-plus-redux/register-plus-redux.php

In register-plus-redux.php there is FPD (as in previous versions). And file 
dash_widget.php (with FPD) was remade to 
dashboard_invitation_tracking_widget.php, which already has no FPD.

Also FPD was fixed at POST request at page 
http://site/wp-login.php?action=register. But in special way it can be 
resurrected.

At adding of new field in Additional Fields and at setting 1 (or almost any 
value) in field Options and at turning on the option Show on Registration, 
FPD will appear at POST request at page 
http://site/wp-login.php?action=register.

Also it's possible to add to the site two FPD vulnerabilities. If to set in 
Custom Logo URL the address to not image file or just "http://", then there 
will be showing error message with FPD at pages 
http://site/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=register-plus-redux and 
http://site/wp-login.php?action=register.
