Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple vulnerabilities in RoundCube.

These are Brute Force, Content Spoofing, Cross-Site Scripting and
Clickjacking vulnerabilities. CS and XSS are in TinyMCE, which is included
with RoundCube.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are RoundCube 0.6 and previous versions (checked in 0.4-beta and
0.6). In last version RoundCube 0.6 uses moxieplayer.swf (instead of
flv_player.swf).

As the developers informed me, these vulnerabilities will be fixed in
version RoundCube 0.7.

Brute Force (WASC-11):

http://site/index.php

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

Swf-file of flvPlayer accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter flvToPlay and
startImage, which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting
addresses of video and/or image files from other site.

http://site/program/js/tiny_mce/plugins/media/img/flv_player.swf?flvToPlay=http://site2/1.flv

http://site/program/js/tiny_mce/plugins/media/img/flv_player.swf?autoStart=false&startImage=http://site2/1.jpg

http://site/program/js/tiny_mce/plugins/media/img/flv_player.swf?flvToPlay=http://site2/1.flv&autoStart=false&startImage=http://site2/1.jpg

Swf-file of flvPlayer accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter flvToPlay,
which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of playlist
file from other site (parameters thumbnail and url in xml-file accept
arbitrary addresses).

http://site/program/js/tiny_mce/plugins/media/img/flv_player.swf?flvToPlay=http://site2/1.xml

File 1.xml:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<playlist>
 <item name="Content Spoofing" thumbnail="1.jpg" url="1.flv"/>
 <item name="Content Spoofing" thumbnail="2.jpg" url="2.flv"/>
</playlist>

XSS (WASC-08):

If at the site at page with flv_player.swf (with parameter jsCallback=true,
or if there is possibility to set this parameter for flv_player.swf) there
is possibility to include JS code with function flvStart() and/or flvEnd()
(via HTML Injection), then it's possible to conduct XSS attack. I.e.
JS-callbacks can be used for XSS attack.

Example of exploit:

<html>
<body>
<script>
function flvStart() {
 alert('XSS');
}
function flvEnd() {
 alert('XSS');
}
</script>
<object width="50%" height="50%">
<param name=movie value="flv_player.swf?flvToPlay=1.flv&jsCallback=true">
<param name=quality value=high>
<embed src="flv_player.swf?flvToPlay=1.flv&jsCallback=true" width="50%"
height="50%" quality=high
pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"
type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed>
</object>
</body>
</html>

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

http://site/program/js/tiny_mce/plugins/media/moxieplayer.swf?url=1.flv

This swf-file accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter url, which allows to
spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of video file from other
site.

Clickjacking:

RoundCube is vulnerable to remote login with using of Clickjacking
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2011-October/008090.html).
About such attacks I've wrote already in my article.

In version RoundCube 0.6-RC there was added protection against Clickjacking
attack (except above-mentioned login form), to which all functionality of
the application is vulnerable. But the method is not effective enough,
because it works only in new versions of some browsers, so all users of
older browsers are unprotected. And old versions of RoundCube are fully
vulnerable to Clickjacking.
