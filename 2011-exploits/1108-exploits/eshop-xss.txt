Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in eShop for Wordpress, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting attacks against logged-in Wordpress Administrator.

1) Input passed via the "eshoptemplate" GET parameter to /wp-admin/admin.php (when "page" is set to "eshop-templates.php") is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=eshop-templates.php&eshoptemplate=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

2) Input passed via the "action" GET parameter to /wp-admin/admin.php (when "page" is set to "eshop-orders.php") is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=eshop-orders.php&view=1&action=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

3) Input passed via the "viewemail" GET parameter to /wp-admin/admin.php (when "page" is set to "eshop-orders.php") is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a administrator's browser session in context of affected website.
