Introduction:
=============
Barracuda Networks - Worldwide leader in email and Web security.
Barracuda Backup Service is a complete and affordable data backup solution. The Barracuda Backup 
Server provides a full local data backup and is combined with a storage subscription to replicate 
data to two offsite locations. This approach provides the best of both worlds - onsite backups for 
fast restore times and secure, offsite storage for disaster recovery. Block level deduplication is 
applied inline to reduce traditional backup storage requirements by 20 to 50 times while also 
reducing backup windows and bandwidth requirements. Cloud Storage with Deduplication

Barracuda Backup Subscription plans provide diverse offsite storage at affordable monthly fees that 
scale to meet increasing data requirements.

    * Secure backup to two geo-separate data centers
    * Deduplicated efficient backup storage
    * Redundant disk-based storage
    * Best-of-breed data retention policies
    * Web interface multi-location management
    * Restore by Web, FTP and Windows software

Product: Backup Application v2.0


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple persistent Input Validation vulnerabilities are detected on Barracudas Backup v2.x. Local low privileged user account 
& remote attackers (with user inter action)can implement/inject malicious persistent script code (Java/HTML). When exploited by 
an authenticated user, the identified vulnerabilities can lead to information disclosure, access to intranet available servers, 
manipulated persistent content.

Vulnerable Module(s):	
					[+] E-Mail Message Browser - Filter
					[+] Expressions
					[+] Exclsuion Rules

1.2
A Header manipulation vulnerability is detected on  Barracudas Backup v2.0 application.
The Vulnerability can be used by attackers to manipulate the running session cookies by including cross-site requests.


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by local low privileged user accounts or remote attackers with high required user inter action. 
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1
Manually reproduce ...
1. Login
2. Switch to the vulnerable module of the barracuda backup application
3. Include your own script code on the vulnerable input section. Save! 
4. Enjoy the persistent output results
