KnFTPd FTP Server v1.0.0 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow caused by improper bounds checking.
By sending an overly long request to Multpile FTP command(USER,PASS,REIN,QUIT,PORT,PASV,TYPE,STRU,MODE,RETR,STOR,
APPE,ALLO,REST,RNFR,RNTO,ABOR,DELE,CWD,LIST,NLST,SITE,STST,HELP,NOOP,MKD,RMD,PWD,CDUP,STOU,SNMT,SYST,XPWD), 
a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges or cause the application to crash.

The sample PoC of exploit is shown as follows:
