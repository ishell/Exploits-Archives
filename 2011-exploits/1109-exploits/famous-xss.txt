Most of the biggest and Famous sites are found to be Vulnerable to XSS
attack . Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security
vulnerability typically found in web applications which allow code injection
by malicious web users into the web pages viewed by other users. Examples of
such code include HTML code and client-side scripts. An exploited cross-site
scripting vulnerability can be used by attackers to bypass access controls
such as the same origin policy. Recently, vulnerabilities of this kind have
been exploited to craft powerful phishing attacks and browser exploits.
Cross-site scripting was originally referred to as CSS, although this usage
has been largely discontinued.
