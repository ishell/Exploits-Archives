Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple security vulnerabilities in AWStats.

These are Cross-Site Scripting, Redirector, SQL Injection, HTTP Response
Splitting and CRLF Injection vulnerabilities in AWStats (in awredir).

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of AWStats (6.0, 7.0 and previous versions).

----------
Details:
----------

AWStats includes script Advanced Web Redirector (awredir.pl). There were
already found (by trev and tx) XSS and Redirector vulnerabilities in
awredir.pl in 2008 (http://sla.ckers.org/forum/read.php?3,23620). They have
not mentioned about SQL Injection, maybe it was due to that affected
functionality of the script was turned off by default.

As I found, version awredir 1.1 (build 1.5) was not vulnerable to XSS, but
version 1.1 (build 1.6) was already vulnerable.

There are XSS, Redirector and SQL Injection vulnerabilities in version 1.1
of the script. And in version 1.2 the protection was added - parameter key.
Which can even be not used (if $KEYFORMD5 is empty), or it can be revealed
by picking up. So the protection with key is not sufficient and can be
bypassed. The parameter key will be needed for version 1.2 for conducting of
Redirector, SQL Injection, HTTP Response Splitting and CRLF Injection
attacks.

In version 1.2 XSS was fixed, but Redirector and SQLi holes were left and
HTTPRS, CRLF Injection and two new XSS were added.

XSS (WASC-08) (in versions <=1.1):

http://site/awredir.pl?url=javascript:alert(document.cookie)

Redirector (URL Redirector Abuse in WASC 2.0) (WASC-38):

http://site/awredir.pl?url=http://websecurity.com.ua

In version 1.2:

http://site/awredir.pl?key=0f3830803a70cc1636af3548b66ed978&url=http://websecurity.com.ua

SQL Injection (WASC-19):

http://site/awredir.pl?url='%20and%20benchmark(10000,md5(now()))/*

In version 1.2:

http://site/awredir.pl?key=f38ed1cdb04c8bda5386f7755a4e1d3e&url='%20and%20benchmark(10000,md5(now()))/*

SQL Injection attack is possible if $TRACEBASE is turned on and DBI is
included.

XSS (WASC-08) (in version 1.2):

http://site/awredir.pl?url=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/awredir.pl?key=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

HTTP Response Splitting (WASC-25):

http://site/awredir.pl?key=04ed5362e853c72ca275818a7c0c5857&url=%0AHeader:1

CRLF Injection (Improper Input Handling in WASC 2.0) (WASC-20):

http://site/awredir.pl?key=4b9faa91e2529400c4f3c70833b4e4a5&url=%0AText

CRLF Injection in logs is possible at turned on $DEBUG and/or $TRACEFILE.

------------
Timeline:
------------

2008.07.22 - after informing developers, trev and tx disclosed XSS and
Redirector holes. After which developers should fixed them correctly (and
also SQLi) and without adding new holes.
2011.09.17 - informed developers.
2011.09.22 - disclosed at my site.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site:
