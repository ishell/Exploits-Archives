Product Description:
Apache Archiva is an extensible repository management software that
helps taking care of your own personal or enterprise-wide build artifact
repository. It is the perfect companion for build tools such as Maven,
Continuum, and ANT.

Archiva offers several capabilities, amongst which remote repository
proxying, security access management, build artifact storage, delivery,
browsing, indexing and usage reporting, extensible scanning
functionality... and many more!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerability Details:
User can insert HTML or execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the
vulnerable application. The vulnerabilities arise due to insufficient
input validation in multiple input fields throughout the application.
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in, but
not limited to, compromise of the application, theft of 
cookie-based authentication credentials, arbitrary url redirection,
disclosure or modification of sensitive data and phishing attacks.
