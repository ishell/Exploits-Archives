Description

Apache Struts 2 framework before version 2.2.3 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks when default XWork generated error messages are displayed. User provided data is not properly escaped before being included in XWork generated errors, thus allowing successful reflected XSS attacks as described below.
 
1. XSS payload injected in the name of the requested Struts actions (Dynamic Method Invocation not enabled)

        http://test.app.net/home<img>.action

2. Reflected XSS vulnerabilities in <s:submit> tag using bash syntax with Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) enabled

a. Reflected XSS via action attribute of <s:submit> tag

        http://test.app.net/home.action?user=&password=&action!login<script>alert(document.cookie)
        </script>:cantLogin=some_value

b. Reflected XSS via method attribute of <s:submit> tag

        http://test.app.net/home.action?user=&password=&action!login:cantLogin<script>alert(document.cookie
        </script>=some_value


Affected Versions

All releases of Apache Struts 2 framework prior to 2.2.3 were found vulnerable to the above attacks.

Other open source and commercial products using XWork framework could be vulnerable to similar attacks. 

WebWork framework released by OpenSymphony (http://opensymphony.org) was confirmed as vulnerable to the attacks described in this advisory.

Mitigation
    
It is recommended to upgrade to Apache Struts 2.2.3 released on 5th of May 2011, or to the latest available version.

Alternatively, it is recommended to implement a custom error page (eg. error_page.jsp) which either uses proper output encoding to display XWork generated errors or displays a generic error message. An example of required configuration in struts.xml file is shown below:

…
<global-results>
  <result name="error">/error_page.jsp</result>
</global-results>
<global-exception-mappings>
  <exception-mapping exception="java.lang.Exception" result="error"/>
</global-exception-mappings>
…
