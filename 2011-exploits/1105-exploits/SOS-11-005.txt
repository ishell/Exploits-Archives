Details.
The Proofpoint Protection Server offers anti-spam and anti-virus,
connection management, email firewall and policy enforcement features.
A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered in the 
Proofpoint Protection Server where input is passed to the query string 
of process.cgi. This has occurred as a result of the application not 
properly filtering HTML tags which allows malicious JavaScript to be 
embedded. When input is incorrectly validated and not properly sanitised 
and then displayed in a web page, attackers can trick users into viewing 
the web page and causing malicious code to be executed.
 
Proof of Concept.
The Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability can be triggered by using the 
following URL:
https://proofpoint.yyy.com.au:10020/enduser/process.cgi?cmd=release&
recipient=xxx@yyy.com.au&
msg_id=%28MDYzMjU0NTJkYTQ0OWRhYjJlNWY1MjBhNzc5MDEwODlkZGY5OGIzMTc1MGI=%29&
locale=enus&x=580&y=470&displayprogress=t%22%20
onmouseover=%22alert%281%29%22%20name=%22frame_display%22%20id=%22
frame_display%22%20NORESIZE%20SCROLLING=%22no%22%20/%3E%3C!--
 
Where: proofpoint.yyy.com.au:10020 is the internal FQDN of the Proofpoint
appliance (this is the link received in the 'quarantine mail alert' email)
Note: the recipient and msg_id parameters do not need to be valid (exist on
Proofpoint) to trigger the vulnerability.
 
Solution.
The vendor has advised that 'Patch 1084' is now available, 
and should be applied to fix this issue.
