Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

http://site/index.html?mailto=MG1112008878;file=path/to/guestbook/message.html;

There is no protection from automated requests (captcha) at page for sending
message to e-mail. The referer is checking at visiting of the page.

Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42):

At sending of a message in form for sending to e-mail, it's sending not only
to owner of e-mail, which wrote the message on the site, but also to 
specified sender's e-mail. Which can be used for sending spam to arbitrary 
e-mails (Spam Gateway).
