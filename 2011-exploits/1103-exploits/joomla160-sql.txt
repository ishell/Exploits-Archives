=================================
 Joomla! 1.6.0 | SQL Injection Vulnerability
=================================


1. OVERVIEW

Joomla! 1.6.0 was vulnerable to SQL Injection.


2. BACKGROUND

Joomla is a free and open source content management system (CMS) for
publishing content on the World Wide Web and intranets. It comprises a
model–view–controller (MVC) Web application framework that can also be
used independently.
Joomla is written in PHP, uses object-oriented programming (OOP)
techniques and software design patterns, stores data in a MySQL
database, and includes features such as page caching, RSS feeds,
printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, polls, search, and
support for language internationalization.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

Parameters (filter_order, filer_order_Dir) were not properly sanitized
in Joomla! that lead to SQL Injection vulnerability.  This could an
attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database,
allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.


4. VERSION AFFECTED

Joomla! 1.6.0

This is the exact same variant as shown in Joomla! 1.5.21:
