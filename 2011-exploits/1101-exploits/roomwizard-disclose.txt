% Vulnerability Overview
************************

The RoomWizard Web based scheduling system with touch screen display uses a
default password: "roomwizard" which would allow remote attackers to obtain
console access at http://DeviceIP:80

Various configuration items can be tampered with once authenticated.


Additionally, a GET request on http://DeviceIP:80/admin/sign/DeviceSynch
will result in a leakage of the Sync Connector username and password on two
input boxes (password masked via type = password):

.....type="text" name="connectorusername" value="DOMAIN/DOMAINID"></td>

.....type="password" name="connectorpassword" value="DOMAINIDPASS"></td>
