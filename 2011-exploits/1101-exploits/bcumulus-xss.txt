Hello list!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in b-cumulus. 
It's widget for Blogger, which is also using at separate sites.

SecurityVulns ID: 11353.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of b-cumulus.

Details:
----------

This XSS is similar to XSS vulnerability in WP-Cumulus, because it's using
modified version of tagcloud.swf made by author of WP-Cumulus. About such
vulnerabilities I wrote in 2009-2010, particularly about millions of flash
files tagcloud.swf which are vulnerable to XSS attacks I mentioned in my
article XSS vulnerabilities in 34 millions flash files
(http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2010-01/msg00035.html).

XSS (WASC-08):

It can be used the file tagcloud.swf or tagcloud-ru.swf.

http://site/path/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

http://site/path/tagcloud-ru.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

Code will execute after click. It's strictly social XSS. Also it's possible
to conduct (like in WP-Cumulus) HTML Injection attack.
