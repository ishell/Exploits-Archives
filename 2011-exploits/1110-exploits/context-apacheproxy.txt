Severity:            High
Category:            Proxy Bypass
Author:              Context Information Security Ltd
Reported to vendor:  16th November 2011
Advisory Issued:     5th October 2011
Reference:           CVE-2011-3368
===============================ADVISORY==============================
 
Description
-----------
Context discovered a security vulnerability which allows for Apache in reverse proxy mode to be used to access internal/DMZ systems due to a weakness in its handling of URLs being processed by mod_rewrite.
 
Analysis
--------
If the Apache configuration file is configured as follows (as previously recommended by Apache):
 
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://internalserver$1 [P]
 
And not with a trailing slash:
 
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://internalserver/$1 [P]
 
Then a request can be made to the proxy server to alter the URL using the user authentication URI syntax, such as:
 
GET @InternalNotAccessibleServer/console HTTP/1.0
 
Causing the proxy to rewrite the URL to:
 
http://internalserver@InternalNotAccessibleServer/console
 
And provide access to the internal server which is not externally accessible.
