Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Lab Research Team discovered multiple remote SQL
Injection vulnerabilities on prosiebens - tvtotal vendor website.


Report-Timeline:
================
2011-09-01:    Vendor Fix/Patch
2011-10-04:    Public or Non-Public Disclosure  [FULL RELEASE]


Status:
========
Unpublished


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
Multiple remote SQL Injection vulnerabilities are detected on Prosiebens
Tvtotal vendor website.
Remote attackers can inject/execute own sql statements over the
vulnerable modules on the affected dbms.
Successful exploitation can result in server & database management
system compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                [+] Player - Index
                [+] Videos Listing
                [+] Community Profiles

Vulnerable Param(s):
                [+] ?list=tag&tag=stefan_raab&tagId=
                [+] ?contentId=
                [+] ?u=

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers. For
