Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple security vulnerabilities in poMMo.

These are Cross-Site Scripting, Brute Force and Insufficient Anti-automation
vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of poMMo (poMMo Aardvark PR16.1 and previous
versions).

----------
Details:
----------

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/pommo/user/pending.php?input=a:2:{s:7:%22adminID%22;b:1;s:5:%22Email%22;s:39:%22%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E%22;}

It will work only after initiation of changing password for admin. Which can
be done (manually or in automated way) by sending required CSRF request to
http://site/pommo/user/pending.php before an attack, or by using IAA
vulnerability on http://site/pommo/index.php (after that XSS is working for
a long time).

Brute Force (WASC-11):

http://site/pommo/user/login.php

It's possible to reveal e-mails of subscribers (which are logins, at that
without passwords), and to receive access to their accounts by revealed
e-mails. And also to use e-mails for spam purposes.

Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

http://site/pommo/user/subscribe.php?Email=1@1.com

In this functionality there is no protection against automated requests
(captcha). Which allows to automatically initiate the process of subscribing
on e-mail (which will spammed these e-mails).
