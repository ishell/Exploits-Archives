# DNS Invalid Compression attack coded by sipher (www.elitter.net)
#
# History:
# elitter.net provides Free UNIX shells and receives its more than fair
amount of DDoS's and DoS
# attacks. 1 lovely day someone targeted our DNS services and managed to
bring the system to 100%
# CPU usage.
#
# Goal:
#
# Reproduce following error message, hopefully get the same results of 100%
CPU usage.
#
# Error output:
#
# Jul  9 19:36:30 42262 mydns[26545]: 09-Jul-2011 19:36:30+359454 #24949
12337 UDP 202.164.36.27 000 000
# FORMERR Invalid_compression_method 13365 0 0 0 LOG N 006 ""
#
# Here is a sample of the packet (tcpdump -lnx port 53):
#
# 4500 002b 512f 4000 3411 92a9 2989 601e
# cc2d 0d15 e483 0035 0017 e98c 3031 3233
# 3435 3637 3839 4142 4344 4500 0000

# So next time you decide to attack someone. You might just squash your bug.

#
# DNS packets use an ad-hoc compression method in which portions of domain
names can sometimes be replaced with two-byte pointers to previous domain
names.
# The precise rule is that a name can be compressed if it is a response
owner name, the name in NS data, the name in CNAME data, the name in PTR
data,
# the name in MX data, or one of the names in SOA data.
# One problem with DNS compression is the amount of code required to parse
it. Reliably locating all these names takes quite a bit of work that
# would otherwise have been unnecessary for a DNS cache. LZ77 compression
would have been much easier to implement.
#
# Another problem with DNS compression is the amount of code required to
correctly generate it. (RFC 1035 allowed servers to not bother compressing
# their responses; however, caches have to implement compression,so that
address lists from some well-known sites don't burst the seams of a DNS UDP
packet.)
# Not only does the compressor need to figure out which names can be
compressed, but it also needs to keep track of compression targets earlier
in the packet.
# RFC 1035 doesn't make clear exactly what targets are allowed.
# (Most versions of BIND do not use pointers except to compressible names;
suffixes of the query name are excluded. dnscache uses pointers to suffixes
of the query name.)
