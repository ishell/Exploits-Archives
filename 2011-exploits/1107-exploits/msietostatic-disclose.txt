Name: Microsoft Internet Explorer 'toStaticHTML' HTML Sanitizing Information Disclosure Vulnerability
Author: Adi Cohen of IBM Rational Application Security (adic@il.ibm.com)
Date: June 14, 2011
Risk: Medium
CVE: CVE-2011-1252


Introduction
-------------
The JavaScript function toStaticHTML, which is found in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9, is used to sanitize HTML fragments from dynamic and potentially malicious content.
If an attacker can manage to pass malicious code through this function, s/he may be able to perform HTML injection based attacks (such as XSS).
 
Vulnerability
-------------
An attacker can create a specially formed CSS that after passing through the toStaticHTML function will contain an expression that will trigger a JavaScript call.

The following JavaScript code demonstrates the vulnerability:

<script>document.write(toStaticHTML("<style>div{color:rgb(0,0,0)&a=expression(alert(1))}</style>Adi Cohen"))</script>	

This code bypasses the filter engine by taking advantage of the following facts:
1.	The filtering engine allows the string "expression(" to exist in "non-dangerous" locations within the CSS
2.	The filtering engine changes special characters (such as & , < , >) to their HTML encoded equivalents (&amp; , &gt; , &lt;), which all end with a semicolon

An attacker can use the semi-colon of the HTML encoded characters to terminate a CSS sentence and start a new one without the filtering engine being aware of it, thereby breaking the state machine.

Impact
------
Any application that relies on the function toStaticHTML to sanitize user supplied data is probably vulnerable to XSS.
