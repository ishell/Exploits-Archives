Hello list!

I want to warn you about Abuse of Functionality, Insufficient
Anti-automation, XML Injection and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in
MyBB.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are MyBB 1.6.1 and previous versions.

In versions MyBB 1.6.2 and 1.4.15 XML Injection and XSS holes were fixed
(http://blog.mybb.com/2011/02/22/mybb-1-6-2-and-1-4-15-security-update/).

Also developers have tried to fix IAA by adding new parameter my_post_key to
request, but it'd not help against IAA. Because it's enough to take value of
this parameter from forum's page (which can be done by program) and later on
to conduct automated login enumeration attack.

Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42):

These functionalities allow to conduct Login Enumeration attack.

http://site/xmlhttp.php?action=username_exists&value=test

Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

These functionalities have no protection from automated attacks. Which
allows to automate login enumeration via Abuse of Functionality
vulnerabilities, to reveal logins of users in the system.

XML Injection (WASC-23):

http://site/xmlhttp.php?action=username_exists&value=%3Cxml/%3E

XSS via XML Injection (WASC-08):

http://site/xmlhttp.php?action=username_exists&value=%3Cdiv%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E%3C/div%3E
