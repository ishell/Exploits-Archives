Introduction:
=============
AdaptCMS is brought to you by Insane Visions, with the v2.0.1 versions being the first big step
in the new generation of software being released by Insane Visions.
AdaptCMS is a long-term development of an idea that started as a gaming CMS where you can
easily control your website (OneCMS), to being useable on any content website.
The AdaptCMS system has always strived to provide that along with great support, continued
updates and just a great CMS altogether. With the 1.x expiring soon, the 2.x series will
pickup as a free-only script (GPL) being completely re-written, brand new design and more
possibilities.
