Hello list!

I want to warn you about new security vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion.
In addition to multiple holes, which I've informed earlier.

These are Information Leakage, Denial of Service and Full path disclosure
vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Adobe ColdFusion 9 and previous versions.

Taking into account that Adobe ignored these (as many others)
vulnerabilities, then administrators of web sites on ColdFusion need to fix
these issues by themselves. Which can be done by using of few simple
methods (hiding admin panel or putting all affected scripts under the
authentication). And there are many sites which are using these methods.

Details:
----------

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

http://site/CFIDE/componentutils/packagelist.cfm

Leakage of the list of all components installed at the server and paths to
them.

DoS (WASC-10):

http://site/CFIDE/componentutils/packagelist.cfm?refreshCache=yes

At this request the update of components cache occurs, which leads to
overload of the server, if large amount of components is installed.

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/CFIDE/adminapi/_datasource/formatjdbcurl.cfm

http://site/CFIDE/adminapi/_datasource/getaccessdefaultsfromregistry.cfm

http://site/CFIDE/adminapi/_datasource/geturldefaults.cfm

http://site/CFIDE/adminapi/_datasource/setdsn.cfm

http://site/CFIDE/adminapi/_datasource/setmsaccessregistry.cfm

http://site/CFIDE/adminapi/_datasource/setsldatasource.cfm

http://site/CFIDE/adminapi/customtags/l10n.cfm

http://site/CFIDE/debug/cf_debugFr.cfm (in body of page with frames)

There are many other FPD in admin panel of ColdFusion.
