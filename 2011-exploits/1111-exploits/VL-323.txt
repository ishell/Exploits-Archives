Introduction:
=============
Joomla is a free and open source content management system (CMS) for publishing content on
the World Wide Web and intranets and a model–view–controller (MVC) Web application framework
that can also be used independently.
Joomla is written in PHP, uses object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques and software design
patterns[citation needed], stores data in a MySQL database, and includes features such as page
caching, RSS feeds, printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, polls, search, and support
for language internationalization.
Joomla had been downloaded 23 million times. Between March 2007 and February 2011 there had been
more than 21 million downloads. There are over 7,400 free and commercial extensions available
from the official Joomla! Extension Directory and more available from other sources

Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
A blind SQL Injection vulnerability was detected on the com_content component of the joomla CMS.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) to inject/execute own sql statements on the affected application dbms.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can result in compromise of the affected application dbms.

Vulnerable Module(s):
					                  [+] com_content


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited be remote attackers. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1: [Site]/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=archive&year=1 [BSQLI]
