Introduction:
=============
Skype is a software application that allows users to make voice and video calls and chats over the Internet. Calls to other users within the
Skype service are free, while calls to both traditional landline telephones and mobile phones can be made for a fee using a debit-based
user account system. Skype has also become popular for its additional features which include instant messaging, file transfer, and
videoconferencing. Skype has 663 million registered users as of 2010.  The network is operated by Skype Limited, which has its headquarters
in Luxembourg. Most of the development team and 44% of the overall employees of Skype are situated in the offices of Tallinn and Tartu, Estonia.
