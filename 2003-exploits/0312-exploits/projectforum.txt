Software   : ProjectForum
Versions   : Version 8.4.2.1 and below
Vendor     : Equi4 Software
Vendor Url : http://www.projectforum.com/projectforum/

Vulnerability:
Bug Type   : Denial of Service; Cross Site Scripting
Severity   : Less Critical

1. Description of Software

"ProjectForum provides a powerful but easy-to-use solution for flexible
workgroup collaboration and coordination of projects and teams over the
web."
- Vendor's Description

2. Bug Information

(a). Denial of Service Attack

It is evident that there is a fault that lies within ProjectForum which
can allow an attacker to cause the server application 'projectforum.exe'
to crash and stop responding to requests from clients.

This can be triggered by sending an overly long 'find' request string to
the server in question. The code which is at fault within the application
is below (in sub procedure/function 0040C4A0...):


:0040C4BA E891751400              Call 00553A50
:0040C4BF 8903                    mov dword ptr [ebx], eax
:0040C4C1 8BCD                    mov ecx, ebp
:0040C4C3 C60001                  mov byte ptr [eax], 01
:0040C4C6 8B3B                    mov edi, dword ptr [ebx]
:0040C4C8 8BD1                    mov edx, ecx
:0040C4CA 83C702                  add edi, 00000002
:0040C4CD C1E902                  shr ecx, 02
:0040C4D0 F3A5                    repz movsd
:0040C4D2 8BCA                    mov ecx, edx


At 0040C4D0 the 'repz movsd' instruction attempts to copy the string which
was sent in the 'find' request through the website's search function
(pointed to by the esi register) into the address space pointed to by the
edi register.

No bounds checking is performed by this function, so it moves data
repeatedly until it reaches an address which it is unable to read from,
this causes the application to crash.


(b). Cross Site Scripting

The internal ProjectForum engine does not seem to make any effort to parse
out dangerous characters which could enable an attacker to insert their
own html code to be rendered with the privileges of the server. Dangerous
outcomes to this could include the stealing of user cookies or the
creation of a fake login page which may enable an attacker to trick the
user giving out sensitive information.

There are many attack vectors for this flaw, including the input boxes in
the administrator login page and the find function, and the error page.

The input box often needs to be escaped by prefixing the html code with a
double quote and a greater-than symbol (">).


NOTE:
Testing has shown that CourseForum, a similar application which uses the
same engine as ProjectForum, is also vulnerable to these attacks.


3. Proof of Concept Code

I have provided a Denial of Service exploit which can be used to test your
systems for this vulnerability.

    The discovery, analysis and exploitation of this flaw is a result of
research carried out by Peter Winter-Smith. I would ask that you do not
regard any of the analysis to be 'set in stone', and that if investigating
this flaw you back trace the steps detailed earlier for yourself.
