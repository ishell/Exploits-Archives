 Administrative Access Vulnerabilities
 -------------------------------------
 If an attacker was to visit ~/gbadmin.cgi, he/she would be 
 prompted for a password.  But if that same attacker was to 
 go directly to the QUERY_STRING and fill in the values for 
 "action", he/she could have total control over the guestbook 
 without the need of any authentication.

 EXAMPLES:

 1. ~/gbadmin.cgi?action=change_adminpass - Change password 

 2. ~/gbadmin.cgi?action=delete_guests - Delete ALL posts on the guestbook.

 3. ~/gbadmin.cgi?action=setup - Change setup information for guestbook.

 4. ~/gbadmin.cgi?action=colors - Modify the look and feel of the guestbook

 5. ~/gbadmin.cgi?action=change_automail - Change emailing information


 Information Disclosure Vulnerability (Reading of Files)
 -------------------------------------------------------
 By taking advantage of the Administrative Access Vulnerabilites, an
 attacker could visit ~/gbadmin.cgi?action=setup and change the
 "guestbook entry file" path to point towards any file (EX: /etc/passwd)
 on the system readable by the account inwhich the httpd is running. 
 After making this change, the attacker would view guestbook.cgi not 
 to read POSTs, but to read the contents of the file above.


 Remote Command Execution
 ------------------------
 Also by taking advantage of the Administrative Access Vulnerability,
 instead of an attacker changing the guestbook entry file path to 
 something such as /etc/password to read that files contents, an
 attacker can insert /path/file;<cmd> <args>| resulting in the
 execution of the cmd at the end of /path/file.

 EXAMPLE: /etc/passwd;touch /tmp/hacked|


 Arbitrary HTML Insertion / Script Injection Vulnerabilities
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 Due to improper filtering, all the scalars below allow the insertion 
 of HTML tags, making guestbook.cgi vulnerable to script injection.

 Even though the gbadmin.cgi offers the option to not allow HTML tags 
 in the $comment field, HTML tags are still accepted.

 sub process_input {
 # process variables
 $name = "$in{'name'}";
 $email = "$in{'email'}";
 $refer = "$in{'refer'}";
 $msn = "$in{'msn'}";
 $aol = "$in{'aol'}";
 $guest_site = "$in{'guest_site'}";
 $comment = "$in{'comment'}";
 $ip = "$in{'ip'}";
 &validate_input;


 Plain Text Administrative Password
 ----------------------------------
 The administrative password can be found in the gbpass.pl file
 also found in the same directory as the rest of the guestbook.
 Combine the permissions recommended by the author in "readme.txt"
 and the plain text password, any "local" users can view the plain
 text password found in gbpass.pl.
