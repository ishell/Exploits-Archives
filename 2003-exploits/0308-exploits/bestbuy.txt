Title: URL Parsing and Plain Text Password disclosure in Best Buy Employee Toolkit Software
Provided by: cm`    cmthemc[at]yahoo.com
----------------
  Best Buy Employee Toolkit Interactive is a software program used nationally by Best Buy Terminal Systems. The software allows employees the ability to check multiple systems throughout the internal network. A URL Parsing vulnerability in the configuration screen could allow an attacker to execute a command shell interface and hijack certain network connections or read plain-text passwords.

Impact: High
-----------------

Analysis:
 -URL Parsing
   By pressing CTRL+SHIFT within the Employee Toolkit software and clicking on the exit button, a logged in user is given access to the Toolkit's configuration screen. An area within the configuration screen allows a logged in user to enter a URL. There are no bounds checking on what is entered in the URL area and an attacker could use this to execute a local command shell or execute other programs locally stored.

 -Plain-text Password Disclosure
   Once an attacker has executed a local command shell, they then have access to the root directory which houses a batch file that remotely mounts the Store's central server. The batch file uses the 'net use' command to map the server's drive and holds the password for the administrator of the central server in plain text.

  By combining the trickery of both the URL Parsing vulnerability and the plain-text password disclosure an attacker could execute telnet to remotely log into the central server as the administrator.

  Finding the servers on the local area network is as easy as executing the 'net view' command at command shell. Another method for finding these servers is to open a page within the employee toolkit and pressing CTRL+P to bring up the printing interface. Choose to print the text to a file then click the network button. This will bring up all of the computers connected to the Best Buy network.
