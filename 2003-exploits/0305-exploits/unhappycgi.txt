Vendor:  Happycgi.com

Product:  Happymall

Versions:  4.3, 4.4

Title:  Happymall E-Commerce Input Validation Flaw Lets Remote Users Execute Arbitrary 
Commands

Description:  Revin Aldi reported an input validation vulnerability in the Happymall 
e-commerce software.  Two scripts allow remote users to execute arbitrary commands with 
the privileges of the web server.

The 'normal_html.cgi' script does not filter user-supplied input before making an open() 
call based on that input.  A remote user can create a specially crafted URL to cause the 
system to execute arbitrary operating system commands.

A demonstration exploit is provided:

/shop/normal_html.cgi?file=|id|

/shop/normal_html.cgi? file=;id|

The vendor reports that the 'member_html.cgi' script is also affected.


Impact:  A remote user can execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the 
target web server.


Solution:  The vendor has issued a fix.  See the attached CERT-KR advisory for more 
information.

==============================================
KA-2003-33: The Vulnerability of File Open Function in Happymall,
             an application of e-commerce.
----------------------------------------------
Published : May 03, 2003
Updated : May 03, 2003
Reference : http://www.certcc.or.kr

-- Systems Affected --------
All web servers running Happymall version 4.3 and 4.4 only

-- Impact --------
The normal_html.cgi and member_html.cgi script of Happymall allow
a remote user to execute arbitrary operating system commands on
the web server with the privilege of web server.

-- Description -----------------
Happymall is an application being used in some e-commerce sites.
Following is what the problem is.

1. If you open normal_html.cgi or member_html.cgi you can find that
there is a sentence, open (A ,"$admin_path/normal_html/$END{'file'}") or
die print "$END{'file'}, which happens to perl programming from time to time.

2. $END{'file'} is looking for file itself in the server to get the value of file.

3. A Remote user possibly exploits a system running Happymall using this vulnerability
only when the value of file is system function.

-- Solution --------------------------
Apply Patch downloaded from :
http://happymall.happycgi.com/forum/forum_detail.cgi?thread=353

How to apply patch to the system :

1. Extract zip file downloaded and you will get two files,
member_html.cgi and normal_html.cgi.

2. Upload those files with ASCII mode to the web server in
the directory containing index.cgi and overwrite.

3. Change the linked address
For example;
Before patch applied : http://test6.happycgi.com/normal_html.cgi?file=company.html
After patch applied : http://test6.happycgi.com/normal_html.cgi?file=company
