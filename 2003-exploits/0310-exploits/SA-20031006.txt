======================================================================



Description
- -----------

Mr. Hornik has discovered vulnerability SA-20031006 in slocate package
version  2.6.  This  is  proof  that  exploitation  is possible and so
unauthorized   users  may  run  arbitraty  code  under  slocate  group
privileges and so read global slocate database.


Exploitation
- ------------

The  exploitation  which  allows overwriting memory management data of
the  heap  was  described  in  original  advisory. We are reffering to
source  lines  from  slocate-2.6-1.src.rpm  from  RH 7.3 here too. The
attached  source  code constants are for RH 7.3 on i686 on 2003/10/10,
except that some parts of them are * here.

The  main  idea  behind  the exploitation is not straightforward, so I
describe  it  below.  The  attached  source code prepares test.db with
following  properties.  It  exploits the bug by:

slocate -i -d test.db `perl -e 'print "B"x1024'`

1, We overwrite one byte of the buffer management headers the overflow
allows  to  overwrite  - it is highest byte of size of memory block of
codedpath. We will trigger realloc on main.c:1269 later.

2,  We are playing here with codedpath, casestr and bucket_of_holding.
They  are  allocated  in this order. When casestr is big enough, it is
placed   on   the   heap  after  codedpath.  By  big  enough  database
bucket_of_holding is reallocated to 0x4002**** region later.

3,  We  need to prepare the area where the codedpath ends according to
overwriten block size so chunk_free called from chunk_realloc will not
fail  because  of  accessing inaccessible memory or finding bad values
there.  But only the highest byte of memory block size can be changed,
so the size change will be multiply of 0x1000000. The needed data (two
small blocks just after overwriten codepath, first memory block marked
as  used)  are  placed  on  0x400*****  by  having them on appropriate
position in database. The change in size is 0x38 * 0x1000000.

4,  We  trigger realloc on main.c:1269, so overwriten block size value
is  used.  We  trigger  realloc  by  prepare path which is longer than
initial  size  (4096  bytes).  We  are  reallocating  to size which is
smaller  than  the overwriten size and big enough to end after casestr
ends.

5,  Then  we  can  overwrite casestr and memory after it by writing to
codedpath  because  memory  management thinks codedpath is so long. We
will  overwrite  the  size  of  memory block of casestr to 0x508 (from
0x408).  Later  free(casestr)  is called and it seems it is top in its
memory  area so free behaves differently than we want. We change it so
comparison of address of next block with top simply fails.

6,  We  place fake memory blocks after casestr such that free(casestr)
overwrites  address  of  close() in GOT to point to our arbitrary code
(by  setting  fake  backward and forward pointers in next (free) block
after  casestr).  On main.c:1357 close(fd) is called and our code gets
the  control.  We  setregid(slocate,slocate) and run the shell. That's
it.
