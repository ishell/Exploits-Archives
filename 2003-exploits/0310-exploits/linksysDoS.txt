Problem:
The Linksys BEFSX41 has web-based administration utility at a predictable 
default address (http://192.168.1.1). The administration is done through a 
series of html forms using the "get" method. The router also has an out of 
the box password of "admin".

Under the default configuration the router is only accessible from the 
local lan and not the internet. However, an attacker could set up a web 
page or send html email to someone inside of the lan to indirectly send 
commands to the router.

An attacker could specify a URL that results in denial of service. The 
denial of service occurs when long string is sent to the System Log 
Viewer's "Log_Page_Num" parameter. The router will be unresponsive after 
the URL is visited when logging is enabled.

Proof of Concept:
If an attacker can get the admin of the router to view a URL like 
http://192.168.1.1/Group.cgi?Log_Page_Num=1111111111&LogClear=0, the 
router will become inoperable. The link could be set as the source of an 
image html tag.

Resolution:
Linksys released an updated firmware to address this issue. This firmware 
update is made available by Linksys from
