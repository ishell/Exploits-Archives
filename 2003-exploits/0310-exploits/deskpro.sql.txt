SUMMARY

DeskPRO (http://www.deskpro.com) is "an integrated script to manage your 
customer sales and support". The DeskPRO product uses a SQL engine (MySQL) to 
store information.
The product contains multiple pages that do not adequately filter our user 
provided data, allowing a remote attacker to insert malicious SQL statements 
into existing ones.


DETAILS

Vulnerable systems:
  * DeskPRO version 1.1.0 and prior

Immune systems:
  * DeskPRO version 1.1.2
 
 Examples:
 http://vulsite.com/deskpro_v1/faq.php?cat=45'
 http://vulsite.com/deskpro_v1/faq.php?article=105'
 http://vulsite.com/deskpro_v1/view.php?ticketid=1'&ticket_pass=
 
The vulnerability is better emphasized by the fact that a remote attacker can 
logon into the system with the administrator username without knowing the 
password by entering the following information in the logon screen:
 
 Email: admin
 Password: 'or''='
