Abstract 

The Kontiki Delivery Management System (DMS) is "a low-cost enterprise
content delivery system that helps large companies rapidly deliver
compelling, rich media communications to employees, customers, and
partners." 

Kontiki DMS is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack based on the
manipulation of URL parameters of a site running this service.

by entering JavaScript in the URL as shown in the example below:

okie)%3C/script%3E

 

The server would process the code and execute the JavaScript on the
user's browser.
