We just want to make a public warning to those users of Motorola/Netopia
Timbuktu Remote Control Software who are using the Internet Locator
service. This service allows to locate any Timbuktu's user just by
knowing the email.

More than five months ago we notified Netopia's customer support
(http://blog.wintercore.com/?p=21), after discovering a hardcoded
user/password pair within SALT.dll.

---------------
v 8.6.5.1373
Dll: SALT.dll
Address: 0x604b83D4
PE section: .rdata
user: xa7z8
pass: e74sa9
url: findme.netopia.com/_REMOVE_THIS_findme/
---------------

By using this information it was possible to access, in real-time, to
hundreds of users' records containing their IP, email, software version
and information related to the license.

We have received no reply since then. 5 months after, we have found out
what we would say an "obvious" patch:
"if the problem was the user/password, well, let's remove it!. Fixed.".
Really hilarious.

Now, *everyone* can access those records without having valid credentials.

Taking into account that there are remote exploits available for that
software, that everyone can grab your IP and software version, and that
there are emails from government, military and high-profile corporate
staff, better you disable that feature.
