!discussion 1 - Denial Of Service

http://wiki.site.org/%08?action=fullsearch&value=linkto%3A%22%0
8%22&context=180

Changing the URL of a linkto URl results in end-user denial of
service conditions if ASCII characters are injected.
===============================================================

===============================================================
!risk 2 - Full Path Disclosure
Medium
Attackers can use this vulnerability to leverage another attack
after the full path has been disclosed.

!discussion 2 - Full Path Disclosure

http://wiki.site.org/VulnVulnVulnVuln/VulnVulnVuln/Vul.........

A remote user is able to identify several details about the
system from the python traceback error after injecting an 
extremely long URL string. The uname -a (the platform and OS),

the python release, the full path of the htdocs folder and 
python folder, and the version of MoinMoin that is running. 
However, MoinMoin v1.80 does not disclose the python release 
and the version of MoinMoin.
===============================================================

===============================================================
!solution
MoinMoin can still be used, but be wary of the full path
disclosure. The vendor has not yet been notified.
