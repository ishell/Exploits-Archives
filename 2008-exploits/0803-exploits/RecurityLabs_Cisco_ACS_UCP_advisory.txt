Overview:
  Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) for Windows User-Changeable 
  Password (UCP) application is a set of CGI programs and web site contents
  installed on Microsoft IIS.

  From the Cisco Advisory:
  "The UCP application enables end users to change their ACS passwords
  with a web-based utility. When users need to change their own
  passwords, they can access the UCP web page by using a supported web
  browser, validate their existing credentials, and then change their
  password via the utility."

  The CGI /securecgi-bin/CSUserCGI.exe suffers from multiple buffer
  overflows exploitable remotely through the HTTP protocol before
  authentication. Additionally, CSUserCGI.exe suffers from a non-persistent
  Cross Site Scripting vulnerability.

Description:
  The main() function of CSuserCGI.exe compares the first command line 
  argument passed to the program using strcmp() against a list of 
  supported arguments, among them "Logout", "Main", "ChangePass", etc. 

  For most of the aguments, it will simply parse the following arguments 
  and pass them to a wsprintf() call with format strings like 
  "Action=%s&Username=%s&OldPass=%s&NetPass=%s". The destination buffer of
  these calls is located in the .data segment of the application.

  In case of the "Logout" argument, main() passes the second argument,
  usually of the form "1234.xyzab.c.username.", as well as a char[] 
  buffer on the stack to a function that first extracts the string up 
  to the first '.' character using strtok and then copies the string 
  into the supplied char[] buffer. The char buffer is 96 bytes long.
  Accordingly, if the string before the first dot character exceeds this
  length, the buffer as well as the return address is overwritten.

Example:
  The following request will cause EIP to be overwritten with 0x42424242.
  The line may wrap, depending on how you view this file.
  https://target/securecgi-bin/CSUserCGI.exe?Logout+AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB.xyzab.c.hacker.

  A non-persistent Cross Site Scripting vulnerability can also be triggered
  using the Help facility of the CGI. An example request would be as
  follows. The line may wrap, depending on how you view this file.
  https://target/securecgi-bin/CSUserCGI.exe?Help+00.lala.c.hacker%22%22%22%3E%3Ch1%3EHello_Cisco%3C/h1%3E

Solution:
  Update to UCP version 4.2.
