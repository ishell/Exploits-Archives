Description

phpstats is a tool creating statistic information about a file tree. Note that 
the name is ambigious, there's more than one tool called phpstats.
The application is vulnerable to simple Cross Site Scripting, which can be 
used to steal authentication information from other webapps if they're 
installed on the same hostname.

Example

Assuming phpstats is installed on http://localhost/phpstats/, one can inject 
JavaScript with:

http://localhost/phpstats/phpstats.php?baseDir=<script>alert(1)</script>&mode=run

Workaround/Fix

Don't use phpstats on a hostname where other web applications are installed.
Vendor has not replied and not fixed the issue yet.
