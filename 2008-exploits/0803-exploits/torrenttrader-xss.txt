Application: TorrentTrader Classic v1.08, possible other versions.

Vendor URL: 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=98584&package_id=1809271.

1. Input passed to the msg property of account-inbox.php is not properly
sanitized before being displayed to the user. A malicious authenticated user
can execute arbitrary HTML and scripting code in a user's browser session in
context of an affected web site.
Example:
http://[host]/account-inbox.php?msg=<script>alert(document.co­okie)</script>&receiver=<username>

2. The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests
without performing any validity checks to verify the request.  A malicious
person can perform a CSRF attack.
Example:
http://[host]/account-inbox.php?msg=<message>&receiver=<username>
