Leopard Server Remote Path Traversal


*Advisory Information*

Title: Leopard Server Remote Path Traversal
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-0123
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/?action=item&id=2189
Date published: 2008-03-18
Date of last update: 2008-03-18
Vendors contacted: Apple Inc.
Release mode: Coordinated release


*Vulnerability Information*

Class: Remote Path Traversal
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 28278	
CVE Name: CVE-2008-1000	


*Vulnerability Description*

MacOS X Server 10.5 [1], also known as Leopard Server features a Wiki
Server [2], which is a multiuser web application written in Python. The
Wiki Server is vulnerable to a path traversal attack, which can be
exploited by non-privileged system users via a forged file upload to
write arbitrary files on locations in the server filesystem, restricted
only by privileges of the Wiki Server application.


*Vulnerable Packages*

. Mac OS X Server v10.5.2 (Leopard Server).
. The Wiki Server is also available for Mac OS X v10.5 (Leopard).


*Non-vulnerable Packages*

View section "Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds".

*Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Rodrigo Carvalho,
from the Core Security Consulting Services (CSC) team of Core Security
Technologies, during Bugweek 2007. Special thanks to Norberto Kueffner
for infrastructure support.


*Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

A path or directory traversal attack technique forces access to files,
directories, and commands that potentially reside outside the web
document root directory. An attacker may manipulate the http requests in
such a way that the web site will write, execute or reveal the contents
of arbitrary files outside the intended path of the web documents. Any
device that exposes an HTTP-based interface is potentially vulnerable to
path traversal.

In the MacOS X Server the python web server called "Wiki Server" is
enabled by default and every system user has a weblog available to post
articles and files. Attached files are written for example in path
'/Library/Collaboration/Users/guest/weblog/3f081.page/attachments/731b1/'
for user 'guest' where '3f081' are hash/random hexa characters assigned
to the blog post title and '731b1' are hash/random hexa characters
assigned to the file uploaded.

Next, we show a Proof of Concept (PoC) attack to the Leopard's Wiki
Server. It creates a file 'popote.php' at '/tmp/[xxxxx]/' where
'[xxxxx]' are random hexa characters assigned to the file, as we have
said. You can write on all the folders where user '_teamsserver', the
user running the Wiki Server, has permissions.

For example, to reproduce the attack using Paros proxy [3], follow these
steps:

- - Check the web server is up.
- - Check you have a system user/password in the system, for example
guest, and the log in.
- - Start editing a new post in your blog.
- - Start Paros proxy, go to Trap tab and enable Trap requests checkbox.
- - Start uploading your preferred file, for example popote.php.
- - In Paros, press Continue until you find the POST request.
- - Append '../../../../../../..' at the beginning of 'popote.php' plus
your wished path, for example '/tmp/'.
- - Press Continue a couple of times to send the request.
- - If user '_teamsserver' has permissions on the wished folder, you will
write file 'popote.php' inside subfolder '[xxxxx]', where [xxxxx] are
hash/random hexa characters that depend on the file.

There are several strategies that can be used in combination with a
path traversal to gain complete control of the victim's server, although
we will not discuss them here.

An example forged request follows:

    The vulnerable code is located at
'/usr/share/wikid/lib/python/apple_wlt/ContentServer.py':


/-----------

def uploadFileCallback(self, result):
	filename, filetype, aFile = result[1][self.type][0]
	filename = filename.decode('utf-8')
	filename = filename.split('\\')[-1] # IE sends the whole path,
including your local username.
	extension = filename.split('.')[-1]
	oldFilename = filename
	uploadType = os.path.split(self.fullpath)[-1]
	if uploadType == "images":
		filename = SettingsManager.findGoodName() + '.' + extension
	logging.debug("beginning file upload: %s" % filename)
	isImage = filenameIsImage(filename)
	newPath = ImageUtilities.findUniqueFileName(os.path.join(self.fullpath,
filename), isImage = (not uploadType == 'attachments'))
	newFilename = os.path.basename(newPath)
	if uploadType == "attachments":
		newParentFolder = os.path.dirname(newPath)
		os.mkdir(newParentFolder)
		newFilename = os.path.join(os.path.basename(newParentFolder), filename)
      [...]


- -----------/


    The hash/random hexa characters used for the attachment subfolder
are generated by code at
'/usr/share/wikid/lib/python/apple_utilities/ImageUtilities.py':


/-----------

def findUniqueFileName(inPath, isImage = True):
	"""Uniqueifies a file name, to avoid duplicates in images and
attachments"""
	filename = os.path.basename(inPath)
	base, extension = os.path.splitext(filename)
	parent = os.path.dirname(inPath)
	aPath = ''
	mungedName = SettingsManager.findGoodName()
	if not isImage:
		#attachment, so make the minged name a subdirectory and put the file
in that
		aPath = os.path.join(parent, mungedName, filename)
		while os.path.exists(aPath):
			mungedName = SettingsManager.findGoodName(mungedName)
			aPath = os.path.join(parent, mungedName, filename)
	else:
		aPath = os.path.join(parent, mungedName + extension)
		while os.path.exists(aPath):
			mungedName = SettingsManager.findGoodName(mungedName)
			aPath = os.path.join(parent, mungedName + extension)
	return aPath

- -----------/


    One possibility for fixing this issue is to use the function
'safePath' from
'/usr/share/wikid/lib/python/apple_utilities/PathHelper.py' to check if
the filename is sane:


/-----------

def safePath(inPath):
	"""Returns whether the path is safe or not as defined by the absence of
arbitrary path traversal elements"""
	pieces = inPath.split('/')
	if '..' in pieces:
		return False
	return True
