Timbuktu Pro Remote Path Traversal and Log Injection


*Advisory Information*

Title: Timbuktu Pro Remote Path Traversal and Log Injection
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-0204
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/?action=item&id=2166
Date published: 2008-03-11
Date of last update: 2008-03-11
Vendors contacted: Motorola
Release mode: Forced release


*Vulnerability Information*

Class: Remote Path Traversal
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 28081	
CVE Name: CVE-2008-1117, CVE-2008-1118	


*Vulnerability Description*

Timbuktu Pro [1] is a desktop-to-desktop remote control software for the
Windows and Macintosh operating systems. The following vulnerabilities
have been identified in Timbuktu Pro:

 1) File transfer directory traversal (CVE-2008-1117): The '\' and '/'
are not properly sanitized when checking the destination filename. The
problem resides in the Notes feature implemented by tb2ftp.dll loaded by
the tb2pro.exe. This is the main issue.

 2) Log input manipulation (CVE-2008-1118): Several fields of the packet
containing peer information (computer name, user name and IP address)
are taken from the packet sent to the target and used to display this
information on the screen of the target.

 The vulnerabilities discovered allow a remote attacker to upload a file
to an arbitrary location on the victim's machine and forge peer
information on the log lines of the victim's application. For example,
an attacker could write an executable in a startup directory of the
victim's machine and wait for the user to restart his/her machine.
Another example is to write a fake system DLL in an existing program
directory, inducing Windows to load this module instead of the real DLL
from 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\'




*Vulnerable Packages*

. Timbuktu Pro 8.6.5 for Windows.
. Timbuktu Pro 8.7 for Mac OS X may also be vulnerable.


*Non-vulnerable Packages*

CORE IMPACT's Exploit Writing Team (EWT), Core Security Technologies.


*Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*



 The most important bug is the directory traversal (1) bug for the Flash
Notes feature of the Timbuktu Pro client.

 Timbuktu Pro is able to send Flash Notes (like an instant message) and
attach files to those notes. Both the message (which will be written to
a text file once received by the target) and the files attached to the
note are transferred to a temporal folder on the target installation
folder (default path is C:\Program Files\Timbuktu Pro\). The file
transfer begins and it is unnoticed by the target user. Once the
transfer is complete, the target user is shown a dialogue on the screen
that displays the message with the names of the files attached.

 The user reads the message and he/she can decide whether or not to keep
the uploaded files. If the user closes the message dialogue, the files
are deleted from the temp folder; otherwise they are kept. The bug
allows the attacker to upload a file to ANY location relative to the
Timbuktu Pro installation folder with an attacker-selected filename for
the target.

 Another very important thing is that when the files are stored outside
the temporal folder, they are not deleted even if the user refuses to
save the file.

 Additionally, the attacker can avoid displaying the dialogue that
notifies the user about the message and the attached files making the
attack invisible for the target.

 The other bug is a logging file content manipulation vulnerability
allowing the attacker to use the data inside protocol's packet to
disrupt the log file with control characters like '\n' and others. This
bug is not very important alone, but could be combined with the
traversal bug to cover tracks about the file upload inserting false log
lines or control characters.

 In the following code the the program obtains the filename from the
packet searching from right to left for the filename without the path
following the last '\'. Then if a '\' character is found then it doesn't
search for the character '/', making it possible to traverse the
directories, sending a filename like '\../../../evil.exe'. In this
example, the resulting filename extracted is '../../../evil.exe'.

 A dangerous possibility is writing an executable in a startup directory
of the victim's machine and wait for the user to restart his/her
machine. Another one is writing a fake system DLL in an existing program
directory, inducing Windows to load this module instead of the real DLL
from 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\'
