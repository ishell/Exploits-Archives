description:Lotus Quickr, announced at Lotusphere 2007, is an evolution of Lotus QuickPlace ,The software use a weak xss filter that an attacker can bypass this xss filter. A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the site running the IBM Lotus Quickr 8.0 software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.

IBM Quickr 8.0 Server Calender XSS Injection:
its seems that IBM Lotus Quickvr use a filter xss,an attacker can avoid this filter .
example of IBM Quickr 8.0 XSS filter:
http://victim.com/QuickPlace/main.nsf/h_Toc/2a922d48c75dd00b052567080016723a/?OpenDocument&Count='20"><script>alert('g')</script>

and then you will get a error message from Quickr:
Due to the presence of characters known to be used in Cross Site Scripting attacks, access is forbidden. This web site does not allow Urls which might include embedded HTML tags.
