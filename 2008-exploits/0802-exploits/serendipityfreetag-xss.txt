* Overview:
Quote from www.s9y.org:
"Serendipity is a PHP-powered weblog application which gives the user an 
easy way to maintain an online diary, weblog or even a complete 
homepage. While the default package is designed for the casual blogger, 
Serendipity offers a flexible, expandable and easy-to-use framework with 
the power for professional applications.
Casual users appreciate the way Serendipity's sophisticated plugin 
architecture allows you to easily modify both the appearance of your 
blog and its features.
You can install more than 120 plugins with just one click, instantly 
enhancing your blog's functionality."

While testing Serendipity an XSS flaw was discovered in the optional 
plugin for tagging entries called "Freetag". For example, this could 
lead to a hijacked Serendipity account.


* Details:
The Freetag-plugin displays the tag name, specified in a URL, back to 
the user.
Due to a defective sanitization of the user's input, it is possible to 
inject arbitrary code which will be reflected on the website.


* Proof of Concept (PoC):
URL: 
http://www.example.com/plugin/tag/%3Cdiv%20style=width:expression(alert(document.cookie));%3E
Hint: PoC does currently work in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6, 
Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 and Netscape Navigator 8.1+ (in Internet 
Explorer rendering mode) only.


* Solution:
We strongly recommend you to upgrade to Freetag version 2.96 which fixes 
this flaw.
