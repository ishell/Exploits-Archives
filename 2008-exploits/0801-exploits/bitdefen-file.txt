Vulnerability / Exploit
===============

The Update Server, which is part of several of BitDefender's Enterprise products, is running an Http-Daemon. The http.exe process is running with localsystem privileges and is vulnerable to the plain old directory traversal vulnerability. Thus it is possible to access files outside of the applications root directory with the named privileges.

To exploit simply do an 

    echo -e "GET /../../boot.ini HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" | nc <server> <port>

or use your webbrowser :)
