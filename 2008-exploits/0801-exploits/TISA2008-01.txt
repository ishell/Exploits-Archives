Introduction
============

The Linksys Wireless-G Broadband Router is really three devices in one box. First, there's the Wireless Access Point, which lets you connect both screaming fast Wireless-G (802.11g at 54Mbps) and Wireless-B (802.11b at 11Mbps) devices to the network. There's also a built-in 4-port full-duplex 10/100 Switch to connect your wired-Ethernet devices together. Connect four PCs directly, or attach more hubs and switches to create as big a network as you need. Finally, the Router function ties it all together and lets your whole network share a high-speed cable or DSL Internet connection.


Security Risk
=============
Linksys WRT54GL is prone to an authentication-bypass vulnerability. Reportedly, the device permits changes in its configuration settings without requring authentication (CSRF).



Technical Description
=====================
Linksys WRT54GL is prone to an authentication-bypass vulnerability. The problem presents itself when a victim user visits a specially crafted web page on an attacker-controlled site. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication and modify the configuration settings of the device.

If the administrator of Linksys WRT54GL is logged into the device and opens a malicious website or email with the same browser, he is subject to attacks.
Imagine the worst case, where the administrator is constantly logged into his firewall appliance because he needs to configure changes throughout
the day. A malicious link executing unnoticed by the administrator may open the firewall.

This issue is reported to affect firmware version 4.30.9; other firmware versions may also be affected.


PoC

https://192.168.1.1/apply.cgi?submit_button=Firewall&change_action=&action=Apply&block_wan=1&block_loopback=0&multicast_pass=0&ident_pass=0&block_cookie=0&block_java=0&block_proxy=0&block_activex=0&filter=off&_block_wan=1&_block_multicast=0&_ident_pass=1

Folowing the previous link will disable the firewall on 192.168.1.1 on your LAN.


Workaround: 
============
1.No official patch yet.

2.Do not surf the web when you are configuring your router.
