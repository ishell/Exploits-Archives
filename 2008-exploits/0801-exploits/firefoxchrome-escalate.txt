Gerry Eisenhaur came with a surprising post
http://www.hiredhacker.com/2008/01/19/firefox-chrome-url-handling-directory-traversal/
. Gerry found a issue in Firefox that allows chrome privilege
escalation. This is due to weak normalization between URI's that are
handled and passed through Firefox with various path encoding methods.
It's a common mistake in browser software not to translate encoded
values back to their correct values and meaning. I wrote about the
same kind of issue before, that only involved a non-malicious example
of traversing directories through the resource:// pointer. This one by
Gerry is far worse, and I really hope browser vendors take a little
more care in handling any resource identifier internally, because this
can lead to serious issues.

Gerry released a pOc that requires the downbar plugin:
<script>pref = function(x, y){document.write(x + ' -> ' + y +
'<br>');};</script>
<script src='chrome://downbar/content/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e
%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fProgram%20Files
%2fMozilla%20Thunderbird%2fgreprefs%2fall.js'></script>
