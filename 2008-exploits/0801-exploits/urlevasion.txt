I dont know if its new but i code it during a PentTest and i would
like to share it with you.
It is based on code developed By sinhack research labs:
http://sinhack.net/URLFilteringEvasion/sakeru.tx

Description:
"Fortinet's URL blocking functionality can be bypassed by
specially-crafted HTTP requests that fulfill 3 factors:

1.- HTTP Requests are terminated by the CRLF characters.
2.- Forcing to talk via HTTP/1.0 version so that dont send the host header.
3.- Finally, by Fragmenting the GET or POST requests

Analysis:

Fortinet's past vulnerability
(http://www.fortiguardcenter.com/advisory/FGA-2006-10.html) said:

Moreover, while it is possible "to bypass the functionality via an
HTTP/1.0 request with no host header", the use of a host field is
actually required to access a specific site on multi-homed web sites.
When no host header is used, the intended web site is actually not
displayed. Therefore, there is no risk.

Macula's Analysis: If you dont have properly installed some AV, HIPS,
etc, through this vuln, a workstation can connect to a malicious
"Hacking Site" and get infected. Also through this vuln, you can
connect to different porn sites without problems. And no matter if its
or not multi-homed web sites. So we consider its not a low risk.


Products affected:
We only tested it on:
fortiGate-1000 3.00, build 040075,070111

Solution:
We tried to contact the vendor, but without any response.

#FortiGuard's URL blocking functionality can be bypassed by
specially-crafted HTTP requests that are terminated by the CRLF
character
#instead of the LF characters and changing version of HTTP to 1.0
without sending Host: Header and Fragmenting the GET and POST Requests
