Date:	2008/12/15

Status:	Full

Class:	Input Validation Error

Bugtraq ID:	N/A

Category:	Cross Site Scripting

Language:	ASP.NET (C#)

Description	Armorize-ADV-2008-0001 discloses multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities that are found in World Recipe, which is an ASP.NET 2.0 C# application and SQL Database with stored procedure to contain and display recipes in a wide variety of categories.

Discussion	World Recipe is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attack because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. Exploiting this vulnerability may allow an attacker to make targeted users executing arbitrary scripts in the context of the affected website. As a result, the attacker may be able to steal authentication credentials such as cookie, to alter the integrity of the visited page, and to launch other attacks such as phishing and force redirect.

GET variables "n" is vulnerable.
