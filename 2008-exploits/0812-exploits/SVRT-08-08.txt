[SVRT-08-08] Google Wap Proxy Vulnerability can be exploited by Hackers to 
attack Internet Users

1. General Information
On 15 December 2008, SVRT-BKIS, from BKIS Center, has found a vulnerability 
in the Wap Proxy service of Google, which allows hackers to cheat Internet 
users.

With this flaw, users are to think that they are using a trustworthy service 
supplied by Google while all their actions are actually performed on 
websites prepared by hackers. This means hackers can easily steal users' 
sensitive information. We have been warning of this hole to Google.

2. Technical Description
Google Wap Proxy, also known as Google Wireless Transcoder, is a service 
that helps translate the content of an arbitrary website into XHTML format 
suitable for Wap browsers on cell phones.

Making use of this service, when users access the link 
http://google.com/gwt/n?u=[http://website] with their cell phones, the 
content displayed by the browsers will be translated from that of the 
website at [http://website]. However, if [http://website] is the address of 
a website prepared by a hacker, he/she can definitely take advantage of the 
service to deceive users.

In order to perform the attack, a hacker creates a website with the 
interface similar to that of Google. Then he's/she's in some way sending 
users a link in the form 
http://google.com/gwt/n?u=[http://fake-google-website]. As this link starts 
with google.com or wap.google.com, domain of Google, users might think it is 
safe and follow all the operations arranged by hackers, which results in 
their losing sensitive information.

In fact, if this service only translated and displayed contents of websites, 
there would be no flaw to be exploited by hackers. The Achilles' heel is 
that users can interact with the websites, in other words, they can still 
login, input personal information and credit card information. via Wap 
Proxy. If the website in effect is created by hackers, all users' actions 
will be saved on hackers' servers.

And for this reason, the vulnerability is due to a design fault in Google 
Wap Proxy Service. We have tested it with a fake website that has the 
interface identical to the Gmail login page. When users login via the site, 
their accounts and passwords will be disclosed. Follow this link to check 
for the test: 
http://google.com/gwt/n?u=http://security.bkis.vn/Proof-of-concept/Google/GmailWap.htm

This service supports cell phone users but due to the fact that the provided 
links could be both wap.google.com and google.com, it also affects all 
Internet users in general.

3. Solution
Rating this vulnerability high severity, Bkis Center recommends that users:
-       Only log into their Gmail accounts at the address 
www.google.com/accounts.
-       Do not perform actions such as logging in, inputting sensitive 
information. when using Google Wap Proxy service.
-       Be cautious with strange links, even links starting with domain 
names of well-known organizations like Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft.
