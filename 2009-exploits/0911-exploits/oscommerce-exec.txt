OS Commerce authentication bypass

Description: Accessing administration pages should give a login 
screen to unauthenticated users, however instead, data is displayed, 
and administrative commands can be executed.  Apparently any page in 
the admin directory can be accessed in this way (including file 
manager and email functionality).

Exploit: http://www.victim.com/catalog/admin/orders.php/login.php

Exploit detection: search webserver logs for ".php/" (with no quotes) 
- there should be no results.  Sample of malicious traffic:

1.2.3.4 - - [04/Nov/2009:19:46:29 +0000] "POST 
/catalog/admin/file_manager.php/login.php?action=processuploads 
HTTP/1.1" 302 5 "-" "User-Agent: Googlebot 2.1"

Workarounds: Secure the /admin folder with .htaccess-based 
authentication.  Hosting providers can add detection of exploit 
strings to their IDS.  A rewrite rule might also be used to detect 
and reject incoming requests containing exploit strings.

Patch: no official patches known

Affected versions: OS Commerce 2.2RC2 - maybe others (untested)

Threat distribution: being used in the wild, possibly by bots

This is not the CSRF issue CVE-2009-0408 as there is no CSRF used in 
the above attack.  Vulnerability #2 at 
http://secunia.com/advisories/33446/ (recently added) seems to be it, 
but I don't see why it's lumped in with the CSRF flaw...
