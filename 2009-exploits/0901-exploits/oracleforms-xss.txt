Oracle Forms Cross site Scripting in (iFcgi60.exe / f60servlet)

About: Oracle Forms is a tool (somewhat like Visual Basic in appearance, but the code inside is PL/SQL) 
which allows a developer to quickly create user-interface applications which access an Oracle database 
in a very efficient and tightly-coupled way. It was originally developed to run server-side in character 
mode on any Unix box, before Windows existed. It was then ported to Windows to function in a client-server 
environment. This could be exploited to conduct cross site scripting attacks. Attackers can run arbitrary 
code that can be executed by the user's browser in the security context of an affected site. Attackers can 
exploit these issues via a web client.
