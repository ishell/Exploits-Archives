Visuplay is a web dev company that offers a CMS that goes with its websites that helps it be managed (after all, that Is what a cms does right?)

Anywho, you can add your own sql code to various query areas through out the CMS like news_article.php and content_page.php. Here's an example that seems to work:
http://www.example.com/html/news_article.php?press_id=1;DROP%20table%20news;--&nav_id=7

As stated in the URL, this will drop the news table, but other stuff can be done no doubt. They even run the CMS on their own site, so I wouldn't be surprised if it were vulnerable as well. 

I emailed the devs, and am awaiting a response. Happy hacking!
