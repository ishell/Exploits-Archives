capability to manage a mobile user’s online access, based upon corporate

Vulnerability overview:
-----------------------

Local exploitation of a design error in SonicWALLs Global Security
Client could allow attackers to obtain increased privileges.


Vulnerability description:
--------------------------

The problem specifically exists because SYSTEM privileges are not
dropped when accessing the GSC properties from the System Tray applet.
The vulnerability can be exploited by right-clicking the System Tray
icon, choosing "Log", right click "Event Viewer", "Open Log File...".
The opened file selected can be abused by navigating to C:\WINDOWS
\SYSTEM32\, right-clicking cmd.exe, then selecting "Open"; doing so
spawns a command shell with SYSTEM privileges.


Proof of concept:
-----------------

This vulnerability can be exploited without any special exploit code.
