http://lampsecurity.org/drupal-role-xss-vulnerability

Vendor Notified: 05/19/09
Vendor Response: Drupal security team responds that this vulnerability
has been publicly disclosed since October 2, 2008 and it is not
considered a "security risk." Ref: http://drupal.org/node/316136.

Description of Vulnerability
- ----------------------------
Drupal (http://drupal.org) is a robust content management system (CMS)
written in PHP and MySQL that provides extensibility through hundreds of
third party modules. The user module is provided as part of the Drupal 6
core modules and contains a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
that can allow users with the 'administer permissions' permission to
inject arbitrary HTML into role names. Users with 'administer
permissions' permission could create new roles containing malicious
JavaScript and silently attack site administrators. While users with
this permission could elevate the permissions of their own role using
permissions they have been granted, this flaw could allow for a
"stealth" attack vector.

Systems Affected
- ----------------
Drupal 6.12 was tested and shown to be vulnerable

Impact
- ------
Authenticated users with 'administer permissions' can exploit this
vulnerability to attack other users with privileges to view roles.

Mitigating factors:
- -------------------
Attacker must have 'administer permissions' permissions in order to
exploit this vulnerability. Having this permission would allow a user to
elevate permissions of their own role so this vulnerability would
represent a more subtle attack vector.

Proof of concept:
- -----------------
1. Install Drupal 6.12.
2. Click Administer -> User management -> Roles
3. Enter "<script>alert('xss');</script>" in the "Name" textarea
4. Click the "Add Role" button
5. Observe JavaScript alert

NB
- ----
Note that this XSS affects several other functions in the Drupal 6
administrative back end.
