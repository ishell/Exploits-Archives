        Multiple XSS in Sun Communications Express


1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Multiple XSS in Sun Communications Express
Advisory ID: CORE-2009-0109
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/content/sun-communications-express
Date published: 2009-05-20
Date of last update: 2009-05-20
Vendors contacted: Sun Microsystems
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Cross site scripting (XSS)
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 34154, 34155
CVE Name: CVE-2009-1729


3. *Vulnerability Description*

Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities were found in the following
files/urls of the Sun Java System Communications Express [1] :

   1. 'https://<server>/uwc/abs/search.xml?'
   2. 'http://<server>/uwc/base/UWCMain'

 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities [2], [3] allow an attacker
to execute arbitrary scripting code in the context of the user browser
(in the vulnerable application's domain). For example, an attacker could
exploit a XSS vulnerability to steal user cookies (and then impersonate
the legitimate user) or fake a page requesting information to the user
(i.e. credentials). This vulnerability occurs when user-supplied data is
displayed without encoding.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

4.1. *SPARC Platform*

   . Sun Java System Communications Express 6.3 (Communications Suite 5
or 6) without patch 122793-26.
   . Sun Java System Communications Express 6 2005Q4 (6.2).


4.2. *x86 Platform*

   . Sun Java System Communications Express 6.3 (Communications Suite 5
or 6) without patch 122794-26.
   . Sun Java System Communications Express 6 2005Q4 (6.2).


4.3. *Linux*

   . Sun Java System Communications Express 6.3 (Communications Suite 5
or 6) without patch 122795-26.
   . Sun Java System Communications Express 6 2005Q4 (6.2).


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Sun Java System Communications Express 6.3 with the patches
described in sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

The Sun Alert for this issue has been assigned id 258068 and it is
available at the following URL:
http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-258068-1.


7. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered by the SCS team from Core Security
Technologies.


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Cross-Site Scripting (commonly referred to as XSS) attacks are the
result of improper encoding or filtering of input obtained from
untrusted sources. Basically, they consist in the attacker injecting
malicious tags and/or script code that is executed by the user's web
browser when accessing the vulnerable web site. The injected code then
takes advantage of the trust given by the user to the vulnerable site.
These attacks are usually targeted at all users of a web application
rather than at the application itself (although one could say that the
users are affected because of a vulnerability of the web application).
The term 'cross-site scripting' is also sometimes used in a
broader-sense referring to different types of attacks involving script
injection into the client. For additional information, please look at
the references [2], [3], [4], [5] and [6].


8.1. *Vulnerability #1 - XSS (BID 34154, CVE-2009-1729)*

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities were found in the following file/url:

/-----------

https://<server>/uwc/abs/search.xml?
- -----------/

 This is part of the 'Personal Address Book->Add contact' functionality.
Although the affected URL is originally accessed through a POST request,
this vulnerability can be exploited both with a GET and with a POST
request. Using the following variables:

/-----------

abperson_displayName
- -----------/

 The contents of the variables previously mentioned are not being
encoded at the time of using them in HTML output, therefore allowing an
attacker who controls their content to insert javascript code.

The following code is a proof of concept of this flaw:

/-----------

https://<server>/uwc/abs/search.xml?bookid=e11e46531a8a0&j_encoding=UTF-8&uiaction=quickaddcontact&entryid=&valueseparator=%3B&prefix=abperson_&stopalreadyselected=1&isselchanged=0&idstoadd=&selectedbookid=&type=abperson%2Cgroup&wcfg_groupview=&wcfg_searchmode=&stopsearch=1&expandgroup=&expandselectedgroup=&expandonmissing=&nextview=&bookid=e11e46531a8a0&actionbookid=e11e46531a8a0&searchid=7&filter=entry%2Fdisplayname%3D*&firstentry=0&sortby=%2Bentry%2Fdisplayname&curbookid=e11e46531a8a0&searchelem=0&searchby=contains&searchstring=Search+for&searchbookid=e11e46531a8a0&abperson_givenName=aa&abperson_sn=aa&abperson_piEmail1=a%40a.com&abperson_piEmail1Type=work&abperson_piPhone1=11&abperson_piPhone1Type=work&quickaddprefix=abperson_&abperson_displayName=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27xss2%27%29%3C%2Fscript%3E%2C+%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27xss1%27%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&abperson_entrytype=abperson&abperson_memberOfPIBook=e11e46531a8a0
- -----------/


8.2. *Vulnerability #2 - XSS (BID 34155, CVE-2009-1729)*

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities were found in the following file/url:

/-----------

http://<server>/uwc/base/UWCMain
- -----------/

 The contents of the url are not being encoded at the time of using them
in HTML output, therefore allowing an attacker who controls their
content to insert javascript code.

This vulnerability can be exploited through a GET request, and the user
does not need to be logged into the web application. This makes this
cross-site scripting vulnerability perfect to be used by attackers on
email-based attacks. An attacker can send via email a link to a
'calendar' and 'exploit' the victim.

The following code is a proof of concept of this flaw:

/-----------

http://<server>/uwc/base/UWCMain?anon=true&calid=test@test.com&caltype=temporaryCalids&date=20081223T143836Z&category=All&viewctx=day&temporaryCalendars=test@test.com%27;alert(%27hello%27);a=%27
- -----------/
