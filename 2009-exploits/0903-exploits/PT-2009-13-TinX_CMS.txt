---[ Vulnerability Description ]

Positive Technologies Research Team has discovered a SQL Injection vulnerability in TinX CMS.

User input passed to the "id" parameter is not properly sanitized. This can allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the "id" parameter.

Example:
http://[server]/system/rss.php?id=1'SQL-code

SQL injection is an attack technique that can be used to extract, modify, add or delete information from database servers that are used by vulnerable web applications. SQL injection vulnerabilities are caused by an unsecured programming technique that allows client-supplied data to interfere with the syntax of SQL queries. SQL is a programming language that is used by applications to communicate with database systems.
