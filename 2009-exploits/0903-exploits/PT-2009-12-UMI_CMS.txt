---[ Software Description ]
 
UMI.CMS is a content management system (CMS) software, usually implemented as a Web application, for creating and managing HTML content. It is used to manage and control a large, dynamic collection of Web material (HTML documents and their associated images).


---[ Vulnerability Description ]

Positive Technologies Research Team has discovered a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in UMI.CMS.

User input passed to the "fields_filter" setting is not properly sanitized. This can be exploited to inject malicious code and allows to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Example:
http://[server]/market/[content_dir]/?fields_filter[price][0]=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C/script%3E&fields_filter[price][1]=1

Malicious users may inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool users in order to gather data from their machines. An attacker can steal the session cookie and take over the account impersonating the user. It is also possible to modify page content presented to the user.


---[ Solution ]
 
Update to version 2.7.1 (build 10856).
