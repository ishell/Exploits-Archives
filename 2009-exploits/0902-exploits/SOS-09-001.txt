Details.
Libero is a library management system. During an application penetration test Sense of Security identified a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search feature of the Libero web application. This occurred as a result of the application not properly filtering HTML tags which allowed malicious Javascript to be embedded. When input is incorrectly validated and not properly sanitised and then displayed in a web page, attackers can trick users into viewing the web page and causing malicious code to be executed. 
 
Proof of Concept.
