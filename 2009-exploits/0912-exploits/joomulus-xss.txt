Hello Bugtraq!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Joomulus 
(mod_joomulus) plugin for Joomla. Which I found at 23.12.2009.

It is similar to XSS vulnerability in WP-Cumulus 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3665/), because it's using tagcloud.swf made by 
author of WP-Cumulus. About millions of flash files tagcloud.swf which are 
vulnerable to XSS attacks I mentioned in my article XSS vulnerabilities in 8 
millions flash files (http://websecurity.com.ua/3789/).

XSS:

http://site/modules/mod_joomulus/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

Code will execute after click. It's strictly social XSS.

Also it's possible to conduct (like in WP-Cumulus) HTML Injection attack, 
including in those flash files which have protection (in flash files or via 
WAF) against javascript and vbscript URI in parameter tagcloud.

HTML Injection:

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wp-cumulus/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='http://websecurity.com.ua'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

Vulnerable are Joomulus 2.0 and previous versions.

I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3801/).
