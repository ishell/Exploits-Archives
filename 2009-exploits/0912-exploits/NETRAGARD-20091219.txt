this advisory may be updated without notice.

[Product Description]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mac OS X is the only major consumer operating system that comes complete
with a fully configured and ready-to-use Java runtime and development
environment. Professional Java developers are increasingly turning to
the feature-rich Mac OS X as the operating system of choice for both
Mac-based and cross-platform Java development projects. Mac OS X  
includes
the full version of J2SE 1.5, pre-installed with the Java Development
Kit (JDK) and the HotSpot virtual machine (VM), so you don't have to
download, install, or configure anything.

Deploying Java applications on Mac OS X takes advantage of many built-in
features, including 64-bit support, resolution independence, automatic
support of multiprocessor hardware, native support for the Java
Accessibility API, and the native Aqua look and feel. As a result,
Java applications on Mac OS X look and perform like native applications
on Mac OS X.


[Technical Summary]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
On November 4th, 2009 ZDI-09-076 was released and subsequently credited
to 'Anonymous'. Given the historic track record with regards to lagging
behind 3rd party "coordinated" disclosures we decided to validate
wether or not OSX was vulnerable in its current state. More importantly
we wanted to validate that the vulnerable classes were reachable via
standard web browser.

The ZDI release contained limited information but that didn't prevent
us from creating a working Proof of Concept ("PoC") for this issue.

As previously mentioned, the prime reason that we decided to look into  
this
vulnerability was because we suspected that it was possible to remotely
trigger and exploit the risk via the Safari Web Browser.  We were right.

The easiest way to validate this was to find an example applet that used
the getSoundbank() function and then to modify
it.

A quick glance at the Sun manual page gave us a hint as to how to
use the function.

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/MidiSystem.html#getSoundbank(java.net.URL)

public static Soundbank getSoundbank(URL url)
throws InvalidMidiDataException, IOException
Constructs a Soundbank by reading it from the specified URL.
The URL must point to a valid MIDI soundbank file.

Parameters:
url - the source of the sound bank data

Returns:
the sound bank

Throws:
InvalidMidiDataException - if the URL does not point to valid MIDI  
soundbank data recognized by the system
IOException - if an I/O error occurred when loading the soundbank

We used a google query to find an example:
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=javax.sound.midi+getSoundbank+applet&aq=f&oq=&aqi=

Luckily the example was an applet which eliminates the question of
accessibility to the vulnerability via applet tag.

http://music.columbia.edu/pipermail/jmsl/2004-November/000555.html

If you modify the above code example we can trigger the bug and get
and some additional information about it.

All of the testing below was done with appletviewer and the following
html page, coupled with our compiled proof of concept class.

$ cat index.html
<title> getSoundBank pwn </title>
</head><body>

<applet code="test.class" width="150" height="25">
</applet>


[Technical Details]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-09-076/ tells us there
is a 'vulnerability [that] allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code on vulnerable installations of Sun Microsystems Java.'

ZDI also states that 'The specific flaw exists in the parsing of
long file:// URL arguments to the getSoundbank() function.' and that
'Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to system compromise under
the credentials of the currently logged in user.'

The code shown below in the Proof of Concept section allows us to  
validate
the statements made by ZDI by triggering the bug and subsequently  
crashing
the JVM.

When the JVM crashes it leaves a log behind in the /Library/Logs/Java
folder that provides useful information.

$ ls /Library/Logs/Java/
JavaNativeCrash_pid1815.crash.log

One of the important things recorded to the log is the address of
the JVM's heap. Since a heap spray is used to place shellcode at
a usable address this is quite useful.

$ cat /Library/Logs/Java/JavaNativeCrash_pid1815.crash.log

Note: The heap within appletviewer is located at '0x25580000'

When triggered with Safari the Heap location is slightly different

...

In that particular trace the Safari Java heap was located at 0x1a270000.

The PoC provided below instructs appletviewer to land in a nopsled.  
Futher
research will yield a functional exploit. In essence this code sprays  
the
heap in order to place attacker controlled code at the proper address  
range
within the heap. With several stack frames under control it is  
possible to
control the flow of execution. Control of an eax address is what leads  
to
final code execution.

[Vendor Status]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Vendor Notified and issue has been Patched

[Vendor Comments]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 1 is now available and addresses the
following:

CVE-ID: CVE-2009-3869, CVE-2009-3871, CVE-2009-3875, CVE-2009-3874,
CVE-2009-3728, CVE-2009-3872, CVE-2009-3868, CVE-2009-3867,  
CVE-2009-3884,
CVE-2009-3873, CVE-2009-3877, CVE-2009-3865, CVE-2009-3866

Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.2 and later, Mac OS X Server v10.6.2 and  
later

Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in Java 1.6.0_15

Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Java 1.6.0_15, the most
serious of which may allow an untrusted Java applet to obtain elevated
privileges.

Visiting a web page containing a maliciously crafted untrusted Java  
applet
may lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the  
current user.
These issues are addressed by updating to Java version 1.6.0_17. Further
information is available via the Sun Java website Credit to Kevin  
Finisterre
of Netragard for reporting CVE-2009-3867 to Apple.

[Why]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
We are often asked "why do you do what you do?". The answer is that
our research helps to educate people about risks that affect them that
might otherwise go unnoticed. Often times our research ends up plugging
holes that might end up resulting in a successful compromise if left
unchecked. Want proof?  Take a look at some of the comments taken
from the article below:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/04/mac_windows_java_attack/

Comment 1: Ben Lambert writes
-----------------------------
"Oh that's just wonderful. So I can't update my
machines to a newer Java version because it breaks my critical app..
..or i can get exploited. I love my job."

Comment 2: windywoo wrote
-------------------------
"This article was the first I heard about the patch so I checked
Software Update and there it was."
