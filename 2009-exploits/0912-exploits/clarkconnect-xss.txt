Hello,

I have found an XSS vulnerability in ClarkConnect web interface.
ClarkConnect is an internet server and gateway that provides protocol filtering, bandwidth management, Windows File Sharing / Samba, LDAP Directory Integration and other features...
The vulnerability was found in the latest version of this product (5.0).
ClarkConnect installs a Web server on port 82 to process the PHP scripts it uses for configuration.

Proof of concept:
http://server_address:82/public/proxy.php?url=<script>alert("XSS")</script>

Obviously, the 'url' GET variable is not well sanitized.

Best regards,
Edgard Chammas [454447415244]
