Description:
------------
WAP Push SI (Service Indication) is a special service SMS which allows 
operators or everyone else to provide an easy way for alerting the 
smartphone user about new services or online resources. (see specification 
WAP-167 for further details)
Some Smartphones fail to properly display the originator of this kind of 
message which leads to a sender obfuscation.

Impact:
-------
This attack can be used in combination with social engineering to mislead 
the recipient to access the resource specified in the WAP Push SI message 
(usually an online resource).

In addition this attack can be used to send spam and hate SMS.


Tested Devices:
---------------
The following devices have been tested and found vulnerable for this kind of 
attack:
It is very likely that other devices and vendors are also vulnerable to this 
attack.

-	Blackberry (Tested on BB 8800, Firmware: 4.5.0.37)
The BlackBerry fails to report the correct originating number and display 
the number of the SMS service center as originator of the message

-	Windows Mobile (Tested on WM5, WM6, WM6.1, WM6.5)
A Windows Mobile driven device fails to properly display the originating 
number and displays whatever information is defined in the 
X-WAP-Initiator-URI field.

-	Sony Ericsson W890i, W810i
The Sony Ericsson W890i and W810i device fails to properly display the 
correct originating number and displays a default string instead.

-	Motorola RazrV3
The Motorola RazrV3 device fails to properly display the correct originating 
number and displays a default string instead.

PoC:
----
The following PDU can be sent to an affected device:
