Research by Hernan Pereira and associates.
No response from Speedy in the past 15 days.
Proceeding with disclosure.

A DoS vulnerability exists in NetCache proxies of at least some areas
of Speedy Argentina ISP (201.255.64/18), by which a URL could be rendered
inaccessible by means of the prefetch cache control directive.

The procedure is very simple, sending several times a simple GET
HTTP/1.1 request to the victim URL will make the proxies no longer
serve it. Users will be waiting for about two minutes and then the TCP
connection will be closed, which depending on the user agent it will
be interpreted as a valid zero-length HTTP 0.9 reply or an error.

It is worth noting that this attack affects the URL EXACTLY. For
instance, attacking http://www.google.com/ will not block
http://www.google.com./ (notice the dot before the last slash), nor
http://www.google.com/whatever neither. However, it is clear enough
that even affecting a single URL is enough to make many sites
unusable.

Since the ISP has its proxies infrastructure half-migrated to BlueCoat
proxies (which don't honor prefetch directive), this vulnerability may
look randomly observable on big sites (like Google) due to the
destination IP-based load balancing. Additionally it seems to be an
extra load balancing which makes some remote IP addresses be caught by
a BlueCoat proxy even though the same IP was handled nearly all times
by a NetCache.

This vulnerability was not present earlier but since Speedy made their
proxies unable to go out with their own IPs, the prefetch couldn't
work anymore and the NetCache proxies seems to not want to spoof the
clients' IP addresses for that URL until the prefetch is done (never).

Here it is a PoC using a Google's IP for the testing purposes, but the
same behavior would be exhibited by the victim proxy with host names:

// Lets check our target IP is handled by a NetCache:
$ printf "TRACE / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 74.125.65.106\r\nMax-Forwards:
