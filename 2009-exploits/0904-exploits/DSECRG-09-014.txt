Details
*******

Multiple Stored XSS vulnerabilities found in SAP Cfolders engine. User which is a business partner of 
organization can steal Administrators cookie by inserting javascript into CFolders system.
He can do this using 2 Stored XSS vulnerabilities.

SAP Server dont associate session identificators with users IP adress or with any other additional data.
IT autentificate users Only by cookies. So any user which can steal administrators cookie can use them to authentificate with administrator rights.


1. User can insert javascript code into site using  link creation option 

He can inject javascript code into LINK field on page

https://[site]/sap/bc/bsp/sap/cfx_rfc_ui/hyp_de_create.htm


example LINK value:

http://test.com" onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)">

Then when administrator will browse for user folders script will execute. 


2. Second XSS vulnerability found in document uploading area.
User can create a document with file name included javascript code.


example filename value:

aaaa"><script>alert()</script>.doc

To do this user must change file name in http request when sending a request for file uploading.

So using this vulnerability user can steal cookie like he do in first example.
