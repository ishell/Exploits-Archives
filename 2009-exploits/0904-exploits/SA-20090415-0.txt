Vulnerability overview:
-----------------------

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in Novell Teaming. These
include enumeration of usernames, information disclosure, and cross site
scripting flaws. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities to
collect information about the system and its users and conduct effective
(XSS supported) hybrid phishing attacks.


Vulnerability description:
-------------------------

1. Username enumeration:

User authentication takes place via a login form at:

https://teaming.example.com/c/portal/login

The web application reacts differently for valid and invalid usernames
("Please enter a valid login" / "Auhtentication failed"). This allows an
attacker to deduce wether a spedific username exists. The attacker could
use this flaw to generate a list of usernames for dictionary- or
bruteforce-attacks.

2. Cross site scripting:

The parameters p_p_state and p_p_mode are not validated or escaped by
the web application. Script code can be injected into these parameters,
allowing for cross site scripting attacks. Example:

https://teaming.example.com/web/guest/home?p_p_id=82&p_p_action=1&p_p_state=%3Cscript%3Ealert('xss+vulnerability')%3C/script%3E&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=2&_82_struts_action=%2Flanguage%2Fview&_82_languageId=de_DE

3. Vulnerable Liferay portal:

Novell Teaming includes a version of Liferay portal with known
vulnerabilities (two cross site scripting flaws):

* Liferay Portal "login" Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
  http://secunia.com/advisories/27537/
* Liferay Portal "emailAddress" Cross-Site Scripting
  http://secunia.com/advisories/27821/
