The main problem exists in parsing url addresses. If we give a lot of
dots, kaspersky avp.exe proccess, will get 100% of CPU and will block
trafic via browsers.
Relativistic time to return to normal behavior is very long. In
practice, when we give a large number of dots, kaspesky will not return
to normal behavior.
