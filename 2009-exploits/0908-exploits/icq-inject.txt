An attacker can try to exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted message to the remote ICQ client.

There are two impacts of the vulnerability has been detected:
1.Information disclosure

2.Spoofing
An attacker can spoof ICQ client software’s system messages, interface elements (buttons, links) in the message window, etc. For example, it could be used for forcing of the ICQ users to click on attacker’s malicious link.
Maybe other impacts are possible.

EXPLOITATION
