Vendor: Eclipse
Advisory: http://antisnatchor.com/2008/12/18/eclipse-birt-reflected-xss/
Author:  Michele "euronymous" Orrù (euronymous AT antisnatchor DOT com)

Quite a common problem in a lot of Java based applications: reflected
XSS in Java stack trace.

A Reflected XSS is present in the _report parameter: here below the modified
request (that is the BIRT 2.2.1 version included in Konakart 2.2.6)

Konakart is actually using org.eclipse.birt.core_2.2.1.r22x_v20070924, that is
actually old.
