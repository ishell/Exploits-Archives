Doz's Security Advisory

Desc: ShopSite Shopping Cart Multiple XSS
Risk: Medium



ShopSite™ is the easiest-to-use shopping cart software for small to medium-sized
businesses. ShopSite ecommerce shopping cart is one of the most user-friendly
online shopping carts on the market.

Vendor: www.shopsite.com


Shopsite is vulnerable to multiple XSS attacks that can lead to
cookie/credential stealing.


Proof of concept:
/shopper/sc/registration.cgi?func=2&storeid=*0af207a4630562&fromid=order.cgi&sbid=SSMSB1165684210.18070&prevlocation=http://eval.shopsite.com/shopper/als/catalog.html%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E


Being a shopping cart just a cross site scripting attack can be really dangerous
to end users.
Until here, this could be just another cross site scripting advisory.
When I contacted David Hills from Shopsite.com reporting the vulnerability with
a snapshot this is what we received from him:

"Your screen shots show the HTML output by our shopping cart.  I do not see any
security hole."

It seems that people wakes up the morning and write shopping carts without
knowing or caring about web application security.

So I felt compelled to warn all the users of ShopSite.
