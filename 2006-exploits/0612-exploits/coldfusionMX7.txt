== Overview ==

This advisory discloses three separate security issues in ColdFusion
MX7.

* Server Path Disclosure * 

It is possible to cause the server to disclose the local path by making 
an invalid request. This information could be used to aide in other file
or path based attacks.

The request must be for an existing file, that has an extension not 
handled by the web server. (ie: not asp,aspx).

The request must be terminated with either of the following;
    /.jws
    /.cfm
    /.cfml
    /.cfc

Some example requests are;
    http://serverip/page1.htm/a.cfm
    http://serverip/CFIDE/administrator/analyzer/img/minus.gif/a.cfm
    http://serverip/jrunscripts/jrun.ini/a.cfm
    http://serverip/jrunscripts/jrunserver.store/a.cfm
    http://serverip/jrunscripts/readme.txt/a.cfm

This has been confirmed against installs that do NOT have debugging or 
robust exception information turned on. 

Sending a request in this format returns a message similar to;
    Error parsing the Tag Library Descriptor
    file:/d:/sekretpath/hidden/page1.htm/..

* Internal IP Address Disclosure *

It is possible to cause the server to disclose the internal network IP
address of the host. This information could be used to aide in other 
network based attacks.

Making a request to the /CFIDE/administrator/login.cfm page WITHOUT 
supplying a host, will result in the internal IP address of the 
server to be disclosed as part of an href tag.

------------------------------------------------------------------
GET /CFIDE/administrator/login.cfm HTTP/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.1

------------------------------------------------------------------

* Cross Site Scripting Protection Bypass *

ColdFusion MX7 appears to have built in protection against cross 
site scripting attacks, and will replace <script> tags with 
<invalid tag>.

Example URL that is converted to a 'safe' format;

http://server/CFIDE/componentutils/cfcexplorer.cfc?
method=getcfcinhtmtestl&name=CFIDE.adminapi.administrator&
path=/cfide/adminapi/administrator.cfctest">
<script>alert()</script>

By inserting a %00 within the <script> tag, it is possible to still 
conduct cross site scripting attacks against users of 
Internet Explorer.

Example URL that will have script executed;

http://server/CFIDE/componentutils/cfcexplorer.cfc?
method=getcfcinhtmtestl&name=CFIDE.adminapi.administrator&
path=/cfide/adminapi/administrator.cfctest">
<%00script>alert(document.domain)</script>

== Solutions ==

Currently, the issues outlined in the report are being considered for 
the next major version of ColdFusion - the release date is currently not

finalized. There is currently no plan to release security bulletins for 
any of the issues from the report
