- Original release date: April 27, 2006

- Discovered by: Jesus Olmos Gonzalez
- Severity: 2/5
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
The BlueSocket web administration is vulnerable to a Cross Site
Scripting attack.

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
BSC 2100 product is included in the Blue Secure Family
(www.bluesocket.com)

BlueSecure Controllers provide high-performance, reliable,
policy-based WLAN security and management solutions that have been
deployed by hundreds of large institutions, enterprises, and public
access providers.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
The admin.pl perl code don't sanitize the imputs and then wen it tries
to rewrite the username at the input, html + script code could be
rewrited and executed by the browser.

This crossite is in the administration of the security product, it has
been tested only in BSC 2100.

Is it possible to send a fake email to the admin spoofing the product
address, saying that the configuration is not ok and sending the
special link.

If the admin press the link and validate in aparently normal
interface, his credentials will be sended to the attacker.

If this is done with a good social engineering will be a great risk.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
This POC will inject some html to modify the look and feel of the
authentication, and attacker could inject script code to send
credentials to him.
