Description:
============
Multiple XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities were found in Inetmedia's web services cityinfo.pl and cityaz.de, which my be exploited by attackers to gain  confidential information and/or modify datebase.

These  flaws  are  due  to  PHP programming mistakes in:
  "http://users.[CITY_NAME].cityinfo.pl/";
  "http://users.[CITY_NAME].cityaz.de/";
  "http://[CITY_NAME].cityinfo.pl/firma.php";
  "http://[CITY_NAME].cityinfo.pl/page_tpl.php";
  "http://[CITY_NAME].cityaz.de/firma.php";
  "http://[CITY_NAME].cityaz.de/page_tpl.php";
  "https://users.[CITY_NAME].pl/";
  "https://users.[CITY_NAME].de/";
  "https://[CITY_NAME].cityinfo.pl/";
  "https://[CITY_NAME].cityaz.de/".

CITY_NAME - name of the city in Poland or Germany.

Probably there are more flaws, which were not discovered during research.
