Description:
CommonSense CMS is a Content Management System that is designed for
content-rich websites created for displaying
AdSense™ ads or affiliate banners. Combined with our prebuilt content
collections and auto-update network, it is a
powerful platform for instantly creating profitable and successful websites.

Affected file:
search.php

There're no filters to special chars like <, >, /, etc. Then an attacker can
execute html code. Chars
like ' and " are replaced by a \ but that's not a problem to a good
attacker, lol...

foreach(explode(" ", $SEARCH) as $t)
{
    $t = ereg_replace("['`]", "", $t);
    $t = ereg_replace("[^a-zA-Z0-9_]", " ", $t);
    if(strlen($t) > 3)
        $queries[] = $t;
}

Example:
http://www.site.com/search.php?q=[XSS]&t=1<http://www.site.com/search.php?q=%5BXSS%5D&t=1>

Google search -> "Powered by CommonSense CMS script"
