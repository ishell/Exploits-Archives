Some vulnerabilities have been discovered in Phorum, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks, disclose sensitive information, and potentially compromise a vulnerable system. 


1) Input passed to the "template" parameter in pm.php isn't properly verified, before it is used to include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local resources.

Example:
http://[host]/pm.php?1,page=1&template=[file]%00



Another unspecified parameter is reportedly also affected. 


Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled and that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.

This can further be exploited to include arbitrary PHP code injected into Apache web logs.

2) Input passed to the "mode" parameter in posting.php isn't properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 5.1.14. Prior versions may also be affected.



 

Solution:
Update to version 5.1.15.
