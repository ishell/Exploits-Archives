According to Microsoft the following tool does nothing to Windows
based machines. According to my experience it does. According to
the experience of 5 separate administrators it does as well. You be
the judge of this. Initially this is/was a tool called bubonic.c
which was modified for some IDS testing on a Cisco ASA5520 so the
tool is a sort of re-post of sorts. Some of the flags were modified
and more ranDUMBness introduced.

The attack was done locally and remotely. Locally this is/was my
setup @ home:

Workstations:
Windows XP Professional Pentium Centrino Laptop
FreeBSD 6.1 Pentium M Laptop
Solaris 10 / Sunfire 280r

Networking:
Cisco 2624
Cisco 3640
Cisco 2970
3Com Superstack
Motorola Surfboard @ 10mb down 3mb up

compiled:

gcc -o achilles achilles.c

(LOCAL ATTACK)
./achilles 10.10.10.4 205.205.205.255 1 1

Remotely it was sent with the same settings and the results were
the same. The targets were two boxes, one on a T3 and the other set
up for me on a DS3 connection in which I sent the attack from my
home to both machines and the results were the same as well. I had
to change the address for the attack though and spoof it from one
of my websites to avoid RFC1918 filtering.

Keep in mind the random() calls which I know offhand will change.
Try it once, try it twice. I've gotten it to work for me every
given time, two testers stated they'd gotten even odder results.
Anyhow, since MS stated they found nothing they won't mind their
write up being quoted on this.

Thanks for responding back a second time around. I saw your first
email but laughed it off. I debated on whether or not to release it
because I know it works. Heck I just finished telling and SHOWING
my new coworkers the attack and offered an explanation of it to
them. Know something... Still worked for me. I also mentioned to
one coworker how you guess tested it with FreeBSD under VMWare and
the thought was there could be an issue with VMWare's take on the
networking stack...

Could be one of two things... Firstly the initial program was
written to break BGP routing so I issued the destport to 179. Then
I wanted to tinker with my IDS at the same time so I set it to
random()... Then I set one to MSRPC so you might have gotten the
random() of which the coding is still the same. Now to be even more
ironic about the whole thing, the version I showed to my coworkers
targeted guess what? Random ports and still shut my MS machine down
at will.

You guys say you can't find anything on it, then there should be no
issues with me releasing it along with mention of you guys finding
no reason to be weary of the tool. I'm sure you guys might want to
do some further investigation else it would look pretty ridiculous
for MS not to be able to find issues while everyone else on say
Bugtraq scratches their heads on MS' miscues. Instead of trying to
exploit in under FreeBSD under VMWare, try it on a dedicated
FreeBSD machine. Heck try it under Linux the code is portable.

No apologies needed. I kind of shrugged it off a long time ago. You
guys say you can't replicate it yet I can whenever I run it. I'm
just curious if others would be able to as well. So far I have had
about 5 trusted sources test it conclusively. All results were the
same. My qualm is that of... Do the script kiddiots need another
idiotic DoS toy? Not really, but at the same time I stay shaking my
head in disbelief you guys can't find nothing while I can break
Windows 2000, 2003SMB, XP at will.
