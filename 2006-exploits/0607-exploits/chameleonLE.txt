Date of Advisory:
-----------------
July 20th 2006

Product:
--------
Chameleon LE <= 1.203

Chameleon Pro is suspected to be vulnerable but since I am cheap and not about to pay $99 for
the pro version to check if a bug exists I CAN NOT
confirm that the Pro version is vulnerable but can assume since it shares most of the same code.

Vendor:
-------
Unidomedia

Description:
------------

Exploit or Vulnerability:
-------------------------
There is a directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php

The vulnerability is at line 34: include "chd_ads/$_GET[rmid]";

The user can pass a directory traversal attack to index.php?rmid= and can load ANY file on the server that the attacker has read access to. This can lead to a user gaining information such as server usernames from the passwd file or reading other website files which could lead to vulnerable information being accessed.

Proof of Concept (PoC):
-----------------------
http://www.victim.com/index.php?rmid=[directory traversal]

Vendor Status:
--------------

Solution:
