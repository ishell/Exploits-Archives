SF-Users V1.0 XSS injection

impact:moderate (privilege escalation,possible defacement)

The username with which you sign up isn't properly sanitized so it's possible to 
insert some javascript there.

The single quote is filtered so we'll have to use &#39; or %27. A username like this:

<IMG SRC=javascript:alert(%27!%27)> would be displayed on the user page as XSS, the rest is left to
your fantasy.
