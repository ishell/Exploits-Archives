   Caucho was notified of this vulnerability on April 20th, 2006.
   They fixed this vulnerability in the latest unofficial snapshot
   of Resin 3.0.19, available from Caucho's website.

4. Solution

   Upgrade to the latest snapshot version of Resin, version 3.0.19.

5. Detailed analysis

   Caucho Resin is a servlet and JSP server. Resin ships with its own
   standalone web server which runs by default on port 8080. Any remote
   user can request URLs of the form:

      http://victim:8080/C:%5C/

   to access the root of the C: drive (and any files below it). Any
   drive letter can be specified.  Only Resin on Windows is vulnerable.

   This vulnerability appears to have been introduced in Resin
   version 3.0.17, although this has not been confirmed by the vendor.
