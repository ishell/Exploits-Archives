Ok, this is absurd, the only form of authentification to the Admin panel is controlled by
a cookie value. Use firefox CookieEditor extension for example and make a cookie of the target 
domain containing a value called Admin and set it to 1 (I really wonder if the word security is
actually in the dictionary you know...)
