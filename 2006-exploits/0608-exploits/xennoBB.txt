------------------- DESCRIPTION -------------------



An exploit exists in the above mentioned versions of XennoBB which

can be exploited by malicious users to transverse various directories

on the server.



Input passed to the "gallery" parameter in profile.php is not properly

sanitized before being used to open the corresponding directory on the

file system. This exploit can lead to manipulation of content in higher

up directories than the script intends.



--------------------- EXPLOIT ---------------------



Submit a forged POST request to



profile.php?action=avatar_gallery&id={your registered user ID here}



With the following as the POST data:



category=../../general/



Successful exploitation leads to images in the /img/general folder

being shown to the user. A similar process can be used to obtain other

confidential system documents or images which may exist on the server.



--------------------- SOLUTION --------------------



Ensure input is correctly sanitized and invalid/not acceptable

characters are removed from the gallery POST variable before the

directory is opened on the server.
