- 1 - Introduction

Written by Khaled Mardam-Bey, mIRC is a friendly IRC client that is
well equipped with options and tools.

- 2 - Vulnerability description

This bug was discovered by a friend (Racy) , with the command exposed
by Racy only hung mIRC, but after debugging and testing, I discover
that allow code execution.
Racy use this command /font -z $readini(c:\a\a.ini,aaaaaaa ,aaaa)
$readini(c:\a\a.ini,aaaaaaa ,aaaa) , in both cases return null and
crash, if the first parameter it's null and the second a long string
can overwrite the EIP and execute code, with user privileges, DON'T
ELEVATE PRIVILEGES.


- 3 - How to exploit it

This PoC open a cmd.exe,also it's possible execute any other code.

- 4 - Solution

Khaled contacted with me about the latest advisory, he says don't have
any bug, any vulnerability.
This is the solution of Khaled:
"as far as I can tell, this is neither an exploit nor a vulnerability.
The above report describes a local bug in mIRC. The author of the
report indicates that any malicious software on your computer can
modify your mIRC settings to cause mIRC to crash. But if you have
malicious software on your computer, you've already compromised your
security..."

I post a response in the messageboard in mIRC forum, telling that a
exploit isn't a malicious software alone, isn't a trojan or virus, and
if a application it's secure, it's impossibly to execute any code, the
user don't compromise the machine if download a exploit, the machine
it's compromised if the program it's vulnerable to the exploit, but
Khaled delete it and close the thread.
