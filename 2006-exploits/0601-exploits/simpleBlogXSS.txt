Zinho's Security Advisory              

Risk: High 


- Note from the author 
Simple Blog is a free weblog application intended for personal use. The  latest version, 2.1, features xhtml/css template structure, rss feed, blog  calendar and an easy to use control panel.

SimpleBlog 2.1 suffers of non-existent user input sanitization so it's  possbile to insert html code and to inject sql.  
It is possible to get admin's password without modifying any database  and without having any privilege. 

I will post only one sample of sql injection and one for xss. Many other  are present. 

SQL Injection: 
/simpleblog/?view=archives&month='&year=2006 

XSS: 
comments.asp allows for html code to be inserted as comment.
