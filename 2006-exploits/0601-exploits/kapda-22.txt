KAPDA New advisory

Vulnerable products : Azbb <= 1.1.00
Vendor:  www.azbb.org
Risk: Low
Vulnerabilities: Cross Site Scripting

Date :
--------------------
Found : Jan 20 2006
Vendor Contacted : Jan 21 2006
Release Date : Jan 21 2006

About :
--------------------
AZbb is "a forum that was written with a primary focus on security.
AZbb does not require a database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL or MSSQL and can even be used as a blog, or a portal".


Vulnerability:
--------------------
Cross_Site_Scripting (XSS,CSS):

AZ Bulletin Board is affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
This issue is due to the failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

As a result of this vulnerability, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user when followed.


PoC :
--------------------

1)

This flaw exists because the application does not validate the "nickname" variable upon submission to the post.php script via the POST method.

h**p://www.[target]/post.php?nickname="><script>alert('XSS')</script><!--



2)[limited XSS]

h**p://www.[target]/post.php?topic=>"<br><iframe%20src=javascript:alert()><br>"
