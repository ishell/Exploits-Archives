Arbitrary Code Injection
This is a null pointer dereference, thanks to H D Moore from Metasploit for help on this issue.

Overview
I have found that Microsoft(R) Internet Explorer 5 and Microsoft(R) Internet Explorer 6 are vulnerable to a Denial of Service. So far all combinations of OS's and IE versions I have tested are vulnerable.  The exploit is triggered by bad HTML data combined with a bad XML block, this html code can by hidden inside a webpage etc.  

Proof of Concept
Any HTML page that contain the following HTML code will cause the DoS:

<table><tr><td><IMG align=left>X X X<?xml:namespace prefix=v ><v:X style="HEIGHT:1"></td></tr></table>
