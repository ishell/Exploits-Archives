Gambling Den bet bypass:

It seems if you don't like your first card you got, you can refresh the screen and another random card will appear on screen. This makes it very easy to guess & cheat at this game.

------------------------------------------

Exploring bypass:

If you just want to power level and don't want to wait for the compass to load you can use the link below. You'll stay on the same tile, but fatique will increase like you're moving, and mobs will attack you.
