3) Description of Vulnerabilities

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in DeluxeBB, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct SQL injection 
attacks and compromise a vulnerable system.

1) Input passed to the "templatefolder" parameter in various scripts 
isn't properly verified, before it is used to include files. This can 
be exploited to include arbitrary files from external and local 
resources.

Examples:
http://[host]/templates/deluxe/postreply.php?templatefolder=[file]
http://[host]/templates/deluxe/posting.php?templatefolder=[file]
http://[host]/templates/deluxe/pm/newpm.php?templatefolder=[file]
http://[host]/templates/default/postreply.php?templatefolder=[file]
http://[host]/templates/default/posting.php?templatefolder=[file]
http://[host]/templates/default/pm/newpm.php?templatefolder=[file]

Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

2) Input passed to the "hideemail", "languagex", "xthetimeoffset", 
and "xthetimeformat" parameters when registering for an account 
isn't properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query. This can 
be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL 
code.

Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.

The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 1.06. Other 
versions may also be affected.

======================================================================
4) Solution

Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised and 
verified.
