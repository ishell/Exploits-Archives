|Description|
+-----------+

Security-Assessment.com discovered an issue regarding privilege separation between different enterprise groups
within BroadWorks. This issue allows a user with Attendant Console privileges to view and record live call detail
records for any user of the system, including users from other organisations. 


+------------+
|Exploitation|
+------------+


Eavesdropping of call detail records requires knowledge of the target userâ€™s BroadWorks username, e.g. 098765432@serviceprovider.com. BroadWorks uses Client Application Protocol (CAP) XML messages to communicate between client applications and the BroadWorks platform. One of the messages, monitoringUsersRequest, is transmitted by the Attendant Console to BroadWorks during the logon procedure. This command includes a list of usernames that the Attendant Console can monitor for incoming and outgoing calls. A malicious user can replay this message with usernames from other enterprises, and once this operation has completed, all incoming and outgoing calls for
the target user(s) will be visible to the Attendant. 

The following is an example XML message to add a target user (in this case, 098765432@serviceprovider.com)
to the monitoring list. This must be sent after successful authentication to the BroadWorks platform.

A basic proxy is available at http://www.security-assessment.com/files/advisories/bwe.py which can intercept
and modify the XML stream, allowing the injection of monitoringUsersRequest packets.
