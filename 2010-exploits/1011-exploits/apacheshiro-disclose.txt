CVE-2010-3863: Apache Shiro information disclosure vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Shiro 1.0.0-incubating
The unsupported JSecurity 0.9.x versions are also affected

Description:
Shiro's path-based filter chain mechanism did not normalize request paths
before performing path-matching logic.  The result is that Shiro filter
chain matching logic was susceptible to potential path traversal attacks.

Mitigation:
All users should upgrade to 1.1.0

Example:
For a shiro.ini [urls] section entry:

/account/** = authc, ...
/** = anon

This states that all requests to the /account/** pages should be
authenticated (as indicated by the 'authc' (authentication) filter) in the
chain definition.

A malicious request could be sent:

GET /./account/index.jsp HTTP/1.1

And access would be granted because the path was not normalized to
/account/index.jsp before evaluating the path for a match.

This issue was discovered by Luke Taylor of SpringSource.
