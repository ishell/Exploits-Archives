Hello All,

Here is another D-Link vulnerability where you can change the network Key
(i.e., WEP, WPAx keys).

Requirement:
1. You need to have access to the internal network of that router. The two
scenarios are mentioned below:

Scenario A: You know the network/ WIFI key to connect to the WIFI network
but you may not have administration privilege to the device. Office scenario
Scenario B: You are on wired LAN and the device is also on the LAN, allowing
users to use the WiFi feature/ service.

*What it does*
The php file in the request allows Internal network systems, i.e., in this
case 192.168.0.0/24, to change the WiFi Key without any authorization. This
will also allow you to change other parameters/ configuration settings of
the device.

Affected Products: DIR-300 (tested) and others

P.S I have sent this bug to DLink but never received any response. Hence I
am disclosing the bug to the PUBLIC.
