Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about new security vulnerabilities in CMS SiteLogic. It's
Ukrainian commercial CMS. In addition to previously reported
vulnerabilities, I will report about vulnerabilities in this CMS, which I
disclosed in 2009 (it's second advisory with vulnerabilities which I
disclosed last year).

-----------------------------

28.06.2009 - when I was informing developers about previous holes (which I
wrote about in previous advisory), I mentioned them that there are many
other holes in their CMS (but they ignored as previous holes, as new ones).
