- --- 0.Description ---
Mac OS is the trademarked name for a series of graphical user
interface-based operating systems developed by Apple Inc. (formerly
Apple Computer,  Inc.) for their Macintosh line of computer systems. The
Macintosh user experience is credited with popularizing the graphical
user interface. The original form of what Apple would later name the
"Mac OS" was the integral and unnamed system software first introduced
in 1984 with the original Macintosh, usually referred to simply as the
System software.


- --- 1. MacOS X 10.6.3 filesystem hfs Denial of Service ---
The main problem exist in implementation of filesystem (hfs). MacOS X
10.6.3 has default hfs filesystem, so the problem came, when we create a
special structure with hardlinks.

Interesting information is in wikipedia :

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link

- ---
...
Most modern operating systems don't allow hard links on directories to
prevent endless recursion. A notable exception to this is Mac OS X v10.5
(Leopard) which uses hard links on directories for the Time Machine
backup mechanism only.
...
- ---

In 10.6 we can't use ln(1) command to create hardlink to directory
(example: # ln C/C CX ). Anyway, we can use link(3) function and we
don't need any special privileges! It hear nice to exploit it.. let's try

To show this issue, we need use this program:

	So we need activate it with line
	
		connlink("C/C","CX");

The above program last.c, creates a structure:

 C / C / C / C / C / C / C / ..
 C / C / CX
 C / C / C / C / CX
 ...

until maxopenfiles limit or ax<20000. But we don't need create so deep
tree (example hfs_poc.c).
To present last.c, we will use _www(70) user and apache child as a main
process.

apache child has created C directory and CX hardlink.

Programs such as:
- - fsck_hfs
- - diskutil
- - "First Aid"
- - etc

are not able to repair the partition where is the directory "CX".

127:hardstyle x$ diskutil verifyVolume /

diskutil has exit with signal 8.

If an attacker can trigger fsck on restart server, the computer
automatically turns off with below result:

- ---

This example has been created with -3000 fts level. so we don't need
create a very deepth tree (min ~512).

let's try remove C and CX directory (created by last.c).

xs-Mac:hardstyle x$ sudo rm -rf C
rm: C: Directory not empty
xs-Mac:hardstyle x$ sudo rm -rf CX
xs-Mac:hardstyle x$

we can't use rm(1) to simple remove C directory (exploit - last.c). We
need divide this process for a few phases.
It is not easy to delete the directory C, however some relationships can
completely prevent it. Let's look at the mechanism maxopenfiles and try
execute "last" a several times.

- --- Run 3 ---

Irregular call to chdir(3) function, is the result of restrictions
maxopenfiles at the time.

So multiple execution of last.c, prevents our struct before destroing.
How deep will come our program, depends on the number of open files on
the system.
The use of entropy in establishing the structure, can completely
prevent, the removal of a defective structure.

Let's see what google know about

"Maximum nesting of folders and directory hard links reached"

http://www.google.pl/#hl=pl&source=hp&q="Maximum+nesting+of+folders+and+directory+hard+links+reached"

Nobody has ever complained of similar problems.

Let's look at:
...
	if (dfs.depth >= DIRLINK_DFS_MAX_DEPTH) {
		fsckPrint(gptr->context, E_DirHardLinkNesting);
		if (fsckGetVerbosity(gptr->context) >= kDebugLog) {
			print_dfs(&dfs);
		}
		gptr->CatStat |= S_LinkErrNoRepair;
		retval = E_DirHardLinkNesting;
	}
...

where

...
/* Assuming that the name of a directory is single byte, the maximum depth
 * of a directory hierarchy that can accommodate in PATH_MAX will be
 * PATH_MAX/2.  Note that catalog hierarchy check puts limitation of 100
 * on the maximum depth of a directory hierarchy.
 */
#define DIRLINK_DFS_MAX_DEPTH 	PATH_MAX/2
...

When we overskip PATH_MAX/2, interesting line is:

		gptr->CatStat |= S_LinkErrNoRepair;

The user _www is able to give flag S_LinkErrNoRepair :)


- --- 2. Fix ---

Currently not available.
The last vulnerability CVE-2009-0689 was removed in version 10.6.3
(after 9 months). So we have to wait
