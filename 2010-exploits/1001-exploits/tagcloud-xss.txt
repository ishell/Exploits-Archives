Hello Bugtraq!

Yesterday I wrote the article XSS vulnerabilities in 34 millions flash files
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3842/), and here is English version of it.

In December in my article XSS vulnerabilities in 8 millions flash files
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3789/) I wrote, that there are up to 34000000
of flashes tagcloud.swf in Internet which are potentially vulnerable to XSS
attacks. Taking into account that people mostly didn't draw attention in
previous article to my mentioning about another 34 millions of vulnerable
flashes, then I decided to write another article about it.

File tagcloud.swf was developed by author of plugin WP-Cumulus for WordPress
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3665/) and it's delivered with this plugin for
WordPress, and also with other plugins, particularly Joomulus
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3801/) and JVClouds3D
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3839/) for Joomla and Blogumus
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3843/) for Blogger. Taking into account
prevalence of this flash file, I'll note that it's most widespread flash
file in Internet with XSS vulnerability.

-------------------------------------
Prevalence of the problem.
-------------------------------------

There are a lot of vulnerable tagcloud.swf files in Internet (according to
Google):

http://www.google.com.ua/search?q=filetype:swf+inurl:tagcloud.swf

If at 18.12.2009 there were about 34000000 results, then now there are about
32500000 results. And these are only those flash files, which were indexed
by Google, and actually there can be much more of them.

So there are about 32,5 millions of sites with file tagcloud.swf which are
vulnerable to XSS and HTML Injection attacks.

Among them there are about 273000 gov-sites
(http://www.google.com.ua/search?q=filetype:swf+inurl:tagcloud.swf+inurl:gov&filter=0)
which are vulnerable to XSS and HTML Injection attacks.

----------------------------------
Vulnerabilities in swf-file.
----------------------------------

File tagcloud.swf is vulnerable to XSS and HTML Injection attacks via
parameter tagcloud.

XSS:

http://site/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

Code will execute after click. It's strictly social XSS.

HTML Injection:

http://site/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='http://websecurity.com.ua'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

HTML Injection attack can be conducted particularly on those flash files
which have protection (in flash files or via WAF) against javascript and
vbscript URI in parameter tagcloud.

----------------------------------------
Examples of vulnerable sites.
----------------------------------------

I gave examples of vulnerable sites with this swf-file in post XSS
vulnerabilities in tagcloud.swf at gov and gov.ua
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3835/).

So for flash developers it's better to attend to security of their flash
files. And for owners of sites with vulnerable flashes (particularly
tagcloud.swf) it's needed either to fix them by themselves, or to turn to
their developers.
