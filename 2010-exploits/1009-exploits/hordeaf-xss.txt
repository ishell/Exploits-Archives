Hi,

Horde Application Framework v3.3.8 and lower are subject to a cross site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The icon_browser.php script fails to properly sanitize user supplied
input to the 'subdir' URL parameter before printing it out as part of a
HTML formatted error message.

The following URL can be used as a proof of concept:

> [path_to_horde]/util/icon_browser.php?subdir=<body onload="alert('XSS')">&app=horde

Prior authentication is not required for exploitation.

This vulnerability was reported to the Horde Project on 19.05.2010 and
fixed by Michael M. Slusarz in the frameworks' GIT repository within a week:
> http://git.horde.org/diff.php/horde/util/icon_browser.php?rt=horde-git&r1=a978a35c3e95e784253508fd4333d2fbb64830b6&r2=9342addbd2b95f184f230773daa4faf5ef6d65e9

Hoping to see an upcoming fixed release (which did not take place)
I have delayed publication - admittedly too much.
