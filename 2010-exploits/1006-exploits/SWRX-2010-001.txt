Cisco ASA HTTP Response Splitting Vulnerability 


Advisory Information
Title: Cisco ASA HTTP Response Splitting Vulnerability 
Advisory ID: SWRX-2010-001
Advisory URL: http://www.secureworks.com/ctu/advisories/SWRX-2010-001
Date published: Thursday, June 24, 2010
CVE: CVE-2008-7257
CVSS v2 Base Score: 5 (Medium) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
Date of last update: Thursday, June 24, 2010
Vendors contacted: Cisco Systems, Inc.
Release mode: Coordinated release
Discovered by: Daniel King, SecureWorks


Summary
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim’s web browser within the security context of the Adaptive Security Appliance site.


Affected Products
Cisco ASA version 8.1(1) and earlier.


Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds
Cisco has released a fix to address this security flaw. Upgrade to ASA software version 8.1(2) to remediate this issue.

Release Notes are available at:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa81/release/notes/asarn812.html

The following “Resolved Caveat” is listed in the Release Notes:
CSCsr09163 webvpn - +webvpn+/index.html http response splitting problem.


Details
When a user connects to the web interface of the ASA via HTTP, they are automatically redirected to the SSL encrypted version. The web server issues a 301 Moved Permanently status code to the connecting client to facilitate this redirection. If the client appends the carriage return (%0d) and line feed (%0a) characters to the URL, the web server will parse these and allow the client to inject arbitrary HTTP response headers. Using this method, it is possible to inject a second Location header to the client. The client web browser will act on only the last Location header it encounters and redirect there.


SecureWorks Risk Scoring
Likelihood (scale of 1-5, with 5 being high): 5 – This device is designed to be on the perimeter of a network to allow remote access.

Impact (scale of 1-5, with 5 being high): 4 – Leveraging this attack could lead to stolen credentials and access to the VPN.


CVSS Severity (version 2.0)
Access Vector: Network exploitable 
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: Not required to exploit
Confidentiality Impact: None
Integrity Impact: Partial
Availability Impact: None
Impact Subscore: 2.9
Exploitability Subscore: 10
CVSS v2 Base Score: 5 (Medium) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
