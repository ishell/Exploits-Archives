4. *Vulnerability Description*

Cross-Site Scripting attacks are a type of injection problem, in which 
malicious scripts are injected into the otherwise benign and trusted web sites.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web 
application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side 
script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are
quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user
in the output it generates without validating or encoding it.
