Users of Gigya Socialize plugin for WP must note, that developers of the
plugin didn't respond me and didn't fix the holes (like admins of one
security site, where I found these holes, which fixed only FPD holes, but
not XSS). So users of the plugin must fix it by themselves.

Best wishes & regards,
