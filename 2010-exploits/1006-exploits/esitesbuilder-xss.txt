Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in eSitesBuilder. It's
Ukrainian CMS which used particularly for e-commerce sites.

These vulnerabilities I found in 2007-2008 years at one online shop site
(and later I found some of these vulnerabilities at another site on this
engine). And recently I found, that this engine for online shops - it's
eSitesBuilder.
