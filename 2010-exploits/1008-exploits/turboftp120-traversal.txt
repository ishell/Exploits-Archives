Vulnerability Details:
When exploited, this vulnerability allows an anonymous attacker to write files to specified locations on a user's system.

The FTP Server does not properly sanitise filenames containing directory traversal sequences that are received from an FTP client, for example
you can upload any file and rename it to "..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\...Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\file.exe", rename
command will move specified file into the autorun folder.

Using files with backslash directory traversal sequences in their filenames, an attacker can potentially write files into a server's Startup folder 
to execute malicious code when the server is restarted. Attacker can also delete any file or folder on Windows file system with vulnerable Turbo 
FTP server.
