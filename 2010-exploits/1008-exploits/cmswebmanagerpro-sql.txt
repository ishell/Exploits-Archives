Hello Bugtraq!

I want to warn you about SQL Injection vulnerability in CMS WebManager-Pro.

SQL Injection:

http://site/index.php?content_id=-1%20or%20version()=4

Affected software:

Vulnerable are CMS WebManager-Pro v.7.4.3 (version from FGS_Studio) and 
previous versions. Original version of CMS WebManager-Pro isn't vulnerable 
(there are two different versions of this CMS from different developers).

I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3576/).

Best wishes & regards,
