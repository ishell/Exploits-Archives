 Description
_______________

EasyManage Content Management System is a modular system designed
by New Zealand company, Face Limited.

It contains two modules which may be easily exploited to carry out
SQL injection attacks.

_______________

 Details
_______________

The vulnerable modules are cms_show_image.php and cms_show_download.php.
Both fail to filter the id paramater before using it in an SQL query.

The following error message is evident when id=1' is passed to
cms_show_image.php:

"Image select failed : You have an error in your SQL syntax;
check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the
right syntax to use near '\'' at line 1"

This generic form of SQL injection can be used to mine data from the 
database, and under certain configurations allow for unauthorised 
access to the CMS or underlying server.
      
_______________

 Solution
_______________

Face Limited were advised of this issue late June, and have released a 
patch to its hosted customers. Independant customers can obtain a patch
by contacting the vendor.
