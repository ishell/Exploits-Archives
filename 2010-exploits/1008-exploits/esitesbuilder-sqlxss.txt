Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about multiple vulnerabilities in eSitesBuilder. After
previous vulnerabilities in eSitesBuilder (SecurityVulns ID:10940), which I
wrote earlier in June, there are Insufficient Anti-automation, Cross-Site
Scripting, SQL Injection and Full path disclosure vulnerabilities in
eSitesBuilder. It's Ukrainian commercial CMS (which is used particularly for
online shops). Both previous and these vulnerabilities were ignored and not
fixed by developers.

Insufficient Anti-automation:

http://site/forget.php

In the form there is no protection against automated requests (captcha).

XSS:

It's single-user persistent XSS (when user is logged in at the site).

POST request to profile page http://site/account.php. Code will work at
profile page (fields Name, Email, Phone, Address 1, Address 2, City, Region)
and at all external pages of the site (field Name).

XSS (persistent):

Via field Name in profile it's possible to conduct attack at the pages:

http://site/products/comments/product/
http://site/products/details/product/

XSS:

http://site/forget.php?e_mail=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E&seenform=y

http://site/index.php?page=search&start_do_search=yes&search_text=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

SQL Injection:

http://site/index.php?page=search&start_do_search=yes&search_text=1&pcat_id=-1%20or%20version()=5

Full path disclosure:

http://site/index.php?page=search&search_text=%3C%3E

Affected products: possibly all versions of eSitesBuilder.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/4303/).
