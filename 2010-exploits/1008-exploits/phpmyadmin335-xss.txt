==============================================================================
 phpMyAdmin 3.3.5 / 2.11.10 <= Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
==============================================================================


1. OVERVIEW

The phpMyAdmin web application was vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting
vulnerability.


2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP intended to handle
the administration of MySQL over the World Wide Web.
phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations with MySQL.
The most frequently used operations are supported by the user
interface (managing databases, tables, fields, relations,
indexes, users, permissions, etc), while you still have the ability to
directly execute any SQL statement.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

Some URLs in phpMyAdmin do not properly escape user inputs that lead
to cross site scripting vulnerability.
For more information about this kind of vulnerability, see OWASP Top
10 - A2, WASC-8 and
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
('Cross-site Scripting').
