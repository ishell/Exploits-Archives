Popular OSC add-on Visitor Web Stats is completely vulnerable to SQL 
injections. Although it uses request data (i. e. the Accept-Language 
header), there's no escaping at all.

This also applies to the extension's derivative for OSC 3, who's author 
completely inherited the insufficient code structure.

I've contacted the official maintainer weeks ago, but he rejected to 
offer a fix. It seems he didn't even put up a note about the issue.

Since most SELECT queries are only used to determine whether the result 
is empty or not, the potential is somewhat limited, but as a PoC the 
following Python code gives you the names and hashed passwords of all 
the admins by going through a binary search tree. (Note that versions 
older than 2.2RC1 do not have admin users; they protect the admin site 
only by htaccess)
