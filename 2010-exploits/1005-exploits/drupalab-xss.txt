CVE-2010-1584

Description of Vulnerability:
- -----------------------------
Drupal (http://drupal.org) is a robust content management system (CMS)
written in PHP and MySQL.  The Drupal Context module
(http://drupal.org/project/context) "allows you to manage contextual
conditions and reactions for different portions of your site."  The
Context module contains a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
because it fails to sanitize block descriptions before display.

Systems affected:
- -----------------
Drupal 6.16 with Context 6.x-2.0-rc3 was tested and shown to be vulnerable.

Impact
- ------
User could inject arbitrary scripts into pages affecting site users.
This could result in administrative account compromise leading to web
server process compromise.

Mitigating factors:
- -------------------
In order to execute arbitrary script injection malicious users must have
'Administer blocks' permission.

Technical discussion and proof of concept:
- ------------------------------------------
Users with 'administer blocks' permission can insert arbitrary script in
block descriptions which is rendered by the Context module at
?q=admin/build/context/X where X is the block id.

Vendor Response:
- ----------------
Drupal security responds that they do not coordinate security fixes for
modules in release candidate designation.  Vulnerability was reported to
the module maintainer via the public issue queue at the direction of
Drupal security.
