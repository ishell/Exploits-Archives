Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in plugin DS-Syndicate for
Joomla.

-----------------------------
Advisory: Vulnerabilities in DS-Syndicate for Joomla
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/4003/
-----------------------------
Affected products: all versions of DS-Syndicate for Joomla.
-----------------------------
Timeline:

16.08.2009 - found vulnerabilities.
04.03.2010 - announced at my site. And after making of announcement of these
vulnerabilities, I found that already in 2008 this SQLi vulnerability was
found by boom3rang (before I found it in 2009). Which disclosed exploit for
it at milw0rm.com (http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/6792). So boom3rang first
found SQLi, and I first found Full path disclosure in this plugin.
09.03.2010 - informed developer (and at developer's site I found that he'd
no more support of this plugin, after his site on Joomla was hacked).
21.05.2010 - disclosed at my site.
-----------------------------
Details:

These are SQL Injection and Full path disclosure vulnerabilities.

SQL Injection:

http://site/index2.php?option=ds-syndicate&version=1&feed_id=-1%20or%20version()=5

Full path disclosure:

http://site/index2.php?option=ds-syndicate&version=1&feed_id=

Note, that developer of the plugin don't support it anymore, so users of the
plugin need to fix it by themselves.

Just after disclosure of these vulnerabilities, I also found new
vulnerabilities in DS-Syndicate which I wrote about in separate advisory.

Best wishes & regards,
