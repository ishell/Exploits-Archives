The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has
assigned the following CVE to this vulnerability: CVE-2010-3743

----------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
Visual Synapse HTTP Server is an open source HTTP server and
also server component for Delphi, Freepascal and C++ Builder
developed by Rene Tegel. The server supports PHP, Perl and CGI
and is distributed both as source and as precompiled binary.

Description:
A vulnerability in the Visual Synapse HTTP server allows remote
attackers to traverse directories on the system. This is
possible by sending a specially-crafted URL request containing
"dot dot" sequences (/..\).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Details:

Example 1:
GET /..\..\..\..\windows/system.ini HTTP/1.0

Example 2:
GET /..\..\..\boot.ini HTTP/1.0

Note: the server was installed in the "C:\Server\VSHTTPD\"
directory.

Sandcat can also be used to identify this issue:

----------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerability Status:

The vendor was notified, but no reply has been received.

The source code of the server warns about possible security
issues and that it is not suitable for production environments
yet. This warning must be taken seriously.

Any application using this source is vulnerable unless the code
is patched. Any machine running the compiled HTTPD Server demo
is vulnerable as well, unless the application is replaced with
an up-to-date and patched version.
