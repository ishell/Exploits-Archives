Facebook is a social networking website with the second highest number
of visits worldwide, and over 500 million active users. Our team
recently performed a quick security audit of the main Facebook site
along with its mobile versions. Here are the full details of our
findings.

I. DESCRIPTION OF THE VULNERABILITIES

Facebook comes with an anti-CSRF system based on two tokens,
respectively called post_form_id and fb_dtsg. These tokens change
frequently, and are certainly built upon several parameters including
time of day, time of account creation, user id, and many others.
Determining the values of these tokens for a specific user is, to our
view, impossible.

Fortunately, Facebook provides a functionality called “profile preview”,
allowing users to see how their own profile appears to any other user.
It can be accessed using the
URL:http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?v=wall&viewas=<viewer_id>. And
this functionality has a bug. When the logged-in user allows anyone to
comment on his wall (via his privacy settings), a form (at least) is
given to allow users to comment on published posts. In such a case, when
you fill the viewas parameter with the id of any user, the script
returns - amongst other things - the post_form_id token of this very
user, along with the form needed to comment on the wall. For example,
setting your privacy settings adequately and going to
http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?v=wall&viewas=4 will reveal the
post_form_id token of Mark Zuckerberg. ;-) 

This bug can also be found on the ajax feed
http://www.facebook.com/ajax/stream/profile.php?__a=1&profile_id=<user_id>&viewer_id=<victim_id>.

Two drawbacks : first, you need the victim’s id to retrieve his/her
post_form_id token. Then, you still need the second token fb_dtsg. The
first problem is actually an easy to solve problem if you use a tiny
CSRF flaw located on the mobile version m.facebook.com. Indeed, the
“like” script does not require any anti-CSRF token: you can use it in a
CSRF attack to retrieve the name, and thus the id, of the victim. 

N.B. : when a user logs into the main site then he is logged on any
mobile version as well, so everything is exploitable on the main
version.

The second problem could have been a serious problem if the Facebook
team had not left us with the possibility to send friend requests
without the fb_dtsg token on the touch version touch.facebook.com. We
consider this as a flaw since a lot can be done once you are friend with
the victim.

We finish the description of the flaws with our last findings, two XSS
flaws located on each mobile version of Facebook, namely m.facebook.com
and touch.facebook.com. More precisely, the incriminated scripts are
http://m.facebook.com/l.php?u=<external adress>&h=<hash> and
http://touch.facebook.com/l_warn.php?u=<external adress>&h=<hash>,
redirecting users to the provided external address. When one omits the h
parameter, the script returns a warning including the external address,
that is not correctly sanitized before being sent back. Here are two
proof-of-concept
URLs :http://m.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://ex.xss/<script>alert(‘XSS’);</script> and http://touch.facebook.com/l_warn.php?u=http://ex.xss/"<script>alert(‘XSS’);</script>


II. IMPACT OF THE VULNERABILITIES

The impact for these flaws can be huge. We have created two different
worms in order to demonstrate the potential of these vulnerabilities.
These worms both spread via a Facebook application that silently loads
an external  malicious script. The first worm takes advantage of the
CSRF flaws by successively retrieving the id and post_form_id of the
victim, and sending a friend request to the attacker through the touch
version of Facebook. 
The attacker then accepts the request (automatically), steals all the
personal info, publishes a post on the victim’s wall to ensure the
spreading, and removes his friendship with the victim. To sum up, this
worm silently recovers all personal info on the victim in a few seconds.

The second worm is far more destructive:  it uses the XSS flaws to
perform a malicious phishing attempt, taking advantage of the trusted
URL apps.facebook.com to fool the victim. The victim has the choice
between giving his/her email+password, and clicking on a button
("Cancel") that launches a request that changes his/her contact email
(which is possible without the user’s password on m.facebook.com),
finally leading to the modification of his/her password using the
“forgotten password” procedure. Once the password recovered or changed,
the attacker logs into the victim’s account, steals all the personal
info including private messages, sends a private message to all the
victim’s friends to ensure the spreading, publishes all the private
messages on the victim’s wall, make the victim’s profile visible to
anyone, and finally erase all the personal data (photos, private
messages, old posts).

These scenarios have been illustrated by our team on two videos, where
we have simulated the propagation of these worms in a small community.

III. SOLUTIONS

All these flaws have been reported to Facebook. All of them are now
patched, except the post_form_id flaw on the preview functionality :
this flaw is no longer useful since Facebook removed the possibility to
send friend requests without the fb_dtsg token on touch.facebook.com.
