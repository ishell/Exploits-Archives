Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about security vulnerability in coWiki.

Earlier I already wrote about XSS vulnerability in coWiki -
SecurityVulns ID:8005 (http://securityvulns.ru/Rdocument692.html).

-----------------------------
Advisory: SQL Injection vulnerability in coWiki
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/3496/
-----------------------------
Affected products: coWiki 0.3.4 and previous versions.
-----------------------------
Timeline:

23.01.2009 - found vulnerability.
12.09.2009 - announced at my site. After which I informed developers (both
original developer and maintainer), but they didn't answer.
21.07.2010 - disclosed at my site.
-----------------------------
Details:

This is SQL Injection vulnerability.

SQL Injection:

http://site/index.php?node=-1'%20or%20version()%3E’5

Already when I informed developers in 2007 about XSS hole, they answered me
that they didn't support this engine any more. So users of this system must
fix this hole by themselves (as previous one).

Best wishes & regards,
MustLive
