Vulnerability found: 12th October 2009

Severity: Medium (Script injection)

Description:

There is a Cross-site Scripting vulnerability on Juniper, IVE web interface.

Procheckup has found by making a malformed request to the IVE Web
interface without authentication, that a vanilla cross site scripting
(XSS) attack is possible.


Successfully tested on:
Juniper Networks IVE version 6.5R1 (Build 14599)

Model SA-2000


Proof of concept:

http://target-domain.foo/dana-na/auth/url_default/welcome.cgi?p=logout&c=37&u=</script><script>alert(1)</script>


Consequences:

An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code
in the browser of a user who clicks on a link or visits a malicious
webpage. The malicious code would run in the security context of the
vulnerable website.

This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the
target site, or the redirection of confidential information (i.e.:
passwords or session IDs) to unauthorised third parties.


Fix:

Ensure that the firewall's management interface is disabled on the
Internet connected interface, by disabling WeBUI within service
options on the Internet connected interface.
