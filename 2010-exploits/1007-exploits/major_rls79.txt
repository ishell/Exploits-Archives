More Details
=============
We at MajorSecurity have discovered some vulnerabilities in PHPKIT WCMS
1.6.5, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct persistent
cross-site scripting attacks. Input passed directly to the
"gbook_welcome" parameter in
"/de/pk/include.php?path=config&mode=guestbook" and to the
"rss_page_text" parameter in
"/de/pk/include.php?path=config&mode=rssfeed" is not properly sanitised
before being stored and returned to the user. This can be exploited to
execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in
context of an affected site.

Solution
=============
Web applications should never trust on user generated input and
therefore sanatize all input. Edit the source code to ensure that input
is properly sanitised.
