DETAILS

LiveZilla is affected by Reflected Cross Site Scripting in server.php, in the “module” track which calls a vulnerable javascript function.

This request: 
	http://<server>/livezilla/server.php?request=track&livezilla=<script>alert('xss')</script>
	
Will pass thru the following files:
htdocs\livezilla\server.php
htdocs\livezilla\track.php
htdocs\livezilla\templates\jscript\jstrack.tpl

And finally land in this excerpt of code:

---
207
208 function lz_tracking_set_sessid(_userId, _browId)
209 {
210 if(lz_session.UserId != _userId)
211 {
212 lz_session.UserId = _userId;
213 lz_session.BrowserId = _browId;
214 lz_session.Save();
215 }
216 }
217
---

The javascript file “jstrack.tpl” is called by track.php and contains a function named “lz_tracking_set_sessid()”.  This function do not sanitize 
data and thus an attacker can inject a malicious javascript code allowing Reflected Cross Site Script attacks against users.
