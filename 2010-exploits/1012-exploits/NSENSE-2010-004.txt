       Technical details
       ---------------------------------------------------------------

       "Afaria is the industry's most powerful and flexible mobile
        device management and security solution for the enterprise.
        Afaria provides you with a single administrative console to
        centrally manage, secure and deploy mobile data, applications
        and devices"

       The web management interface does not validate the origin of
       administrator requests thus it is vulnerable to Cross Site
       Request Forgery.

       Successful exploitation may allow an attacker to execute code
       on the target system via custom malicious event handlers
       utilizing UNC paths.
