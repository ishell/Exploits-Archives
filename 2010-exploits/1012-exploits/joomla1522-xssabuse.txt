Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about Insufficient Anti-automation, Abuse of
Functionality and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in Joomla.
Vulnerabilities exist in component com_mailto, which is a core component
of Joomla.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of Joomla with corresponding functionality
(Joomla! 1.5.22 and previous versions). XSS vulnerabilities are lacking in
Joomla! 1.5.21 and 1.5.22 (security site, where I found these
vulnerabilities, is using old version of Joomla), so they exist in more
earlier versions of the system.

Details:
----------

In details about such Insufficient Anti-automation and Abuse of
Functionality vulnerabilities it's possible to read in my article Sending
spam via sites and creating spam-botnets
(http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2010-07/msg00099.html).

Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

http://site/component/mailto/?tmpl=component&link=1

There is no protection at the page from automated requests (captcha). The 
time-out is using for protection in the system, but it's easily bypassing.

Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42):

It's possible to send spam to arbitrary e-mails (it's possible to spoof all
important fields, and also to spoof URL in Joomla before 1.5.7). And with
using of Insufficient Anti-automation vulnerability it's possible to send
spam from the site in automated manner on a large scale.

XSS (WASC-08):

POST request at page http://site/component/mailto/?tmpl=component&link=1

" style="xss:expression(alert(document.cookie))
In fields: E-mail to, Sender, Your E-mail, Subject.

------------
Timeline:
------------

2010.09.21 - announced at my site.
2010.09.23 - informed developers.
2010.12.09 - disclosed at my site.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/4549/).
