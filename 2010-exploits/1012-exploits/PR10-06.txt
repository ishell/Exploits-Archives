Description
A remote URI redirection vulnerability affects the PGP Universal Web
Messenger. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly
sanitize URI-supplied data assigned to the 'retryURL' parameter.

attacks against unsuspecting users by causing an arbitrary page to be
loaded once a PGP Universal Web Messenger specially-crafted URL is visited.

Vulnerable server-side script: '/b/lnj.e?'

Unfiltered parameter: 'retryURL'
Proof of concept
Example of specially-crafted URL:

https://target-domain.foo/b/lnj.e?retryURL=//www.procheckup.com

Consequences:

Victim users can be redirected to third-party sites for the purpose of
exploiting browser vulnerabilities or performing phishing attacks.
How to fix

Web Messenger.
