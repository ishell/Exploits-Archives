    * Description
      DotNetNuke is a Content Management System (CMS) that is based on the .Net framework. Procheckup has discovered that a DotNetNuke programs is vulnerable to a generic reflective Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

      Note: DotNetNuke was tested on a fully patched Windows 2003 R2 SP2 and IIS 6, and SQL 2005 were used as the application server and the backend database.
      DotNetNuke Versions tested 5.05.01 patched till the 30 October 201
    * Proof of concept
      The following demonstrate the XSS flaw:-
      Install page XSS (note the system tested the install process had been completed).

      http://target-domain.foo/Install/InstallWizard.aspx?__VIEWSTATE=<script>alert(1)</script>

      Consequences:
      An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code in the browser of a user who clicks on a link to a exposed Mura site. Such code would run within the security context of the target domain. This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the target site, or the redirection of confidential information (i.e.: session IDs) to unauthorised third parties.
    * How to fix
      As of the 3 December no patch has been released.
