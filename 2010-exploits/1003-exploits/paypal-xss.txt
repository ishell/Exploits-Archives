Paypal is affected by an XSS vulnerability where it fails to validate
input for the following url:

https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=

One can add arbitrary javascript with no need for any filter evasion.

    https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=<script> alert("xss"); </script>


As far as I know only the above url is affected. All of the usual XSS
attacks will work with this.

Cheers.
