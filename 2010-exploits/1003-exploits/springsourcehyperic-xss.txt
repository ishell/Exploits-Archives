CVE-2009-2907: SpringSource Hyperic HQ multiple XSS vulnerabilities

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: SpringSource

Versions Affected:
SpringSource Hyperic HQ 4.2 pre-release versions
SpringSource Hyperic HQ 4.1.0 to 4.1.2
SpringSource Hyperic HQ 4.0.0 to 4.0.3
Earlier unsupported versions may also be affected

Summary:
Multiple fields are vulnerable to stored XSS.

Description:
Data retrieved from the database was used directly when forming the HTML output. This allowed an attacker to enter HTML in many of the input fields and have it used when the field was later displayed to a user. Data is now suitably encoded to make it safe for inclusion in HTML.

Mitigation:
Hyperic HQ Open Source users should upgrade to Hyperic HQ 4.2
Hyperic HQ Enterprise 4.1.x users may upgrade to Hyperic Enterprise 4.2 or 4.1.2.1
Hyperic HQ Enterprise 4.0.x users may upgrade to Hyperic Enterprise 4.2 or 4.0.3.2
Users of any earlier version should upgrade 4.2

Example:
Paste the following code into the description field:
<SCRIPT>alert("XSS Vulnerable")</SCRIPT>

Credit:
This vulnerability was discovered and reported to SpringSource by Aaron Kulick of CBS Interactive.
