Vulnerable: BBSMAX 4.2     BBSMAX 4.1       BBSMAX 3.0

 
For example:
http://bbs.example.com/forum1/post.aspx?action=newthread"><script>alert(/liscker/)</script>
 
BBSMAX Home Page : http://www.bbsmax.com/

BBSMAX is prone to an cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied 
input. An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the 
context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other 
attacks. 
 
The three versions of BBSMAX is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
