===========
I. Overview
===========
During a penetration test performed by Hacktics' experts, certain
vulnerabilities were identified in an IBM Websphere Portal Server and Lotus
Web Content Management deployment. Further research has identified that the
login page of the IBM Lotus Workplace Web Content Management is vulnerable
to Reflected Cross Site Scripting attacks.

A friendly formatted version of this advisory is available in:
   http://www.hacktics.com/content/advisories/AdvIBM20100224.html

===============
II. The Finding
===============
An attacker can inject script into a URL pointing at the vulnerable page,
and attack system users by sending it to them. Users, who follow the link,
will be attacked with the injected script.

============
III. Details
============
The login page takes the query string from the request URL and embeds it
into the HTML response as the value of a form field named success. The
attack is done by escaping the field (">), followed by the relevant script,
as seen in the following URL:
 
http://[host]:[port]/wps/wcm/webinterface/login/login.jsp?"><script>maliciou
s_script</script><b%20"

Note: The content of this parameter is used as part of a page redirection
performed after the login. Even without XSS exploitation, this can be used
for invalidated redirection.

===========
IV. Exploit
===========
The exploit is performed by replacing malicious_script with the relevant
javascript payload. An evasion for simple XSS signature protection (where
applicable), can allow executing the same script without using HTML tags, as
seen in the following sample:
   http://[host]:[port]/wps/wcm/webinterface/login/login.jsp?"
style="tr:expression(malicious_script)
