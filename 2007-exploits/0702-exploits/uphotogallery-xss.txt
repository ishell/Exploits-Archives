Uphotogallery Multiple Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability


Uphotogallery has been developed to run exclusively on web sites hosted on Windows Servers with Internet Information Server 4.0 or higher and ASP 3.0 installed. No other Platforms are supported. Uphotogallery supports both Microsoft Access and Microsoft Sql Server databases. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Cross-site request forgery, also known as one click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF or XSRF, is a kind of malicious exploit of websites. Although similar-sounding in name to cross-site scripting (XSS), it is a very different and almost opposite form of attack. Whereas cross-site scripting exploits the trust a user has in a website, a cross-site request forgery exploits the trust a Web site has in a user by forging a request f
 rom a trusted user. Compared to XSS attacks, CSRF attacks are often less popular (so there are fewer defense resources available) and more difficult to defend against, and thus are considered to be more dangerous.
