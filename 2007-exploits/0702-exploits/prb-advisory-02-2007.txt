Security advisory: Arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability in
php rrd browser (prb)

II - SUMMARY

Description: Arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability in
php rrd browser < 0.2.1

Author: Sebastian Wolfgarten (sebastian at wolfgarten dot com),

Date: February 11th, 2007

Severity: Medium

References: http://www.devtarget.org/prb-advisory-02-2007.txt

III - OVERVIEW

Quote from sourceforge.net: "Prb stands for php rrd browser, inspired by
rrdbrowse and cacti. A modular framework for creating rrd databases,
updating and graphing data, based on apache, php, mysql and rrdtool. It
will allow you to graph just about anything you like". More information
about the product can be found online at http://prb.sourceforge.net.

IV - DETAILS

Due to inproper input validation, the web application "php rrd browser"
(versions <0.2.1) is vulnerable to an arbitrary file disclosure
vulnerability. It allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to read any
file on the remote system if the user the webserver is running as has
permissions to do so. Thus an attacker is able to gain access
potentially sensitive information.

V - EXPLOIT CODE

The vulnerability is trivial to exploit and only requires specifying an
URL with a relative file path on the remote system such as

http://$target/prb/www/?p=../../../../../../../etc/passwd

As the input to the "p" parameter is not validated in any way accessing
this URL will expose the contents of /etc/passwd to a remote attacker.

VI - WORKAROUND/FIX

To address this problem, the author of prb (Guillaume Fontaine) has
released an updated version (0.2.1) of the software which is available
at http://prb.sourceforge.net. Hence all users of prb are asked to test
and install this version as soon as possible.
