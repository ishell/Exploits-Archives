2) Security Issues
-------------------

--- [ Remote Persistent XSS ] ---
=================================

YA Book is vulnerable to an XSS. A malicous user can put in the City Field HTML or JS code
(in sigin module: http://host/path/index.php?mode=sign) as shown below:

Eg script:

<script>alert("XSS")</script>

The vulnerability exist because the city field is not properly sanitized before being used!

--- [ PoC ] ---
===============

A guest can posts a new message and after put the right captcha :D he can puts in the city field a code like:

<script>location.href="http://host.com"</script>

for a redirect with JS or.. he can injects other (eg: HTML, JS) codes..


3) Patch
--------

Edit the source code to ensure that the input is properly sanitized before being used.
