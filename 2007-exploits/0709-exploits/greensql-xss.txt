1) Introduction
===========
GreenSQL is an Open Source database firewall used to protect databases from SQL injection attacks. GreenSQL works in a proxy mode and has built in support for MySQL. The logic is based on evaluation of SQL commands using a risk scoring matrix as well as blocking known db administrative commands (DROP, CREATE, etc).

permanent xss

3)Proof of concept
=====
well the proof of concept can be anywhere , like a login form, an url value everythings is loggued in the green-sql
admin panel. the problem is because there's no filter , so the script logs your query in the database 
and then it's printed in the alert section . this can be pretty nastie ... you "protect" your script agains sql injection with a firewall , but you have a permanent xss in the panel . and actually only the admin see the logs .
so you know that the cookie is the good one !

an exemple can be given in the demo website :
http://www.greensql.net/sql-injection-test  fill login or password with <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
then go in the admin panel :http://demo.greensql.net/   xss will be executed .
