/users/kb.php?category_id=XSS


Example of Advance Exploitation of the Application:

Once we have found that the application is vulrnable to Cross Site Scripting we see
that there is a form that will be our source of input to manipulate the Files.
Now we can advance this type of attack by injecting an evil script trough profile.php
page. Now we can inject any code into the Email Box and submit. Than you can view the 
result of code by going /users/tickets.php and "Submit New Ticket"
