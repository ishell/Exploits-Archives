 [HSC] Bitweaver XSS & SQL Injection Vulnerability


Bitweaver is an open source content management system. Its speed and
power are ideal for large-scale community websites and corporate applications,
but it is simple enough for non-technical small site users to set up and
administrate. It comes fully featured on install but is easy to extend.
