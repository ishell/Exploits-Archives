Description
The Serendipity blog system contains a plugin to display the content of feeds 
in the sidebar (serendipity_plugin_remoterss). If an attacker can modify the 
RSS feed, it's possible to inject javascript code in the link part, because 
it's not correctly escaped.

Sample code
Sample feed injecting code:
<rss version="2.0">
<channel><item><title>foo</title>
<link>" onMouseOver="alert(1)</link></item></channel>
</rss>

Workaround/Fix
Serendipity developers have fixed this in svn and all further version, please 
update to 1.2.1 or above.
