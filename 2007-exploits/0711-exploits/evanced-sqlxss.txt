First off, script code can be injected into all fields when you register for some event. This presents a possibility for cookie theft from logged in users. 

Next off, theres there exists an SQL injection point from the eventsignup variable

eventsignup.asp?ID=4197  UNION ALL SELECT username, etc FROM users--

Now theres the Evanced Summer reader Suite.
summer re•ader

viewreviews.asp?ProgramID=35 union all select lol FROM lol--&CurrPage=2

XSS also works in the user registration page for the name, and all other info, and a nice XSS exists under user reviews for every field in patronlogadd.asp 

The fun doesnt stop there. Next we have Room Rese•rve

XSS works in the room reservation area.
