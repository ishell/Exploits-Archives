Citrix NetScaler contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the web management interface. None of the parameter values of /ws/generic_api_call.pl are sanitized before they get embedded in the HTML output. As an example, parameter "standalone" can be exploited as follows:

http://(target)/ws/generic_api_call.pl?function=statns&standalone=%3c/script%3e%3cscript%3ealert(document.cookie)%3c/script%3e%3cscript%3e


The vulnerability has been identified in version 8.0, build 47.8.
However, other versions may be also affected.


Solution:
Do not stay logged into the NetScaler web management interface while browsing other web sites.
