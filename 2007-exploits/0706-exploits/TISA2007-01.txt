Description:

TeamIntell has reported a vulnerability in Letterman 
Subscriber Module (mod_letterman) for Joomla! CMS which 
can be exploited by malicious people to conduct script 
insertion attacks.

Input passed to the "Itemid" parameter in 
mod_lettermansubscribe.php is not properly sanitised 
before being used. This can be exploited to insert 
arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session 
in context of an affected site.

The vulnerability is reported in version 1.2.4-RC1. Other 
versions may also be affected.

Developer has released version 1.2.5 which fixes this 
issue.
