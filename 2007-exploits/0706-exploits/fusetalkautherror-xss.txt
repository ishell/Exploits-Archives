Hello everyone,

After trying to report a SQL bug (autherror.cfm) to FuseTalk, and seeing them
providing patches to customers (dropping new fixed .cfm files in a private place
reserved to customers) without giving proper credits and without reporting them
publicly (we were following the Full Disclosure Policy v2.0), we decided to
release the advisories without contacting them concerning the other bugs we
found. Here is the second one:
