SecureScout Testcase ID:
TC 17961
Vulnerable Systems:
eTicket version 1.5.5 (new version 1.5.5.1 is also vulnerable)
Vulnerability Type:
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) to force a web-site to display malicious contents to the target, by sending a specially crafted request to the web-site. The vulnerable web-site is not the target of attack but is used as a tool for the hacker in the attack of the victim.

Vendor:
HM2K

Vendor Status: 
HM 2K from eTicket got the Draft advisory on 21 May 2007 and got extensive support in how to fix the security problems on 23 May 2007 and 28 May 2007.
In HM 2K's own words HM 2K "lost interest" and HM 2K "seriously found it too difficult to orchestrate what you [netVigilance] were asking from me [HM 2K], so I just did what I thought was best.". netVigilance's tests show that version 1.5.5.1 is also vulnerable. There currently is no official fix for this advisory.

Workaround:
In the php.ini file set register_globals = Off. 
Example: 
REQUEST:
http://[TARGET]/[PRODUCT FOLDER]/open.php?err=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
OR
http://[TARGET]/[PRODUCT FOLDER]/open.php?warn=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
REPLY:
Will execute <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
