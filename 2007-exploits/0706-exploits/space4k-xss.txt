Description:
============
Space4K is a massive multiplayer online game game which can be played 
via the browser. Space4k has several divisions for different countries, 
e.g. .de for German speaking users, .com for English speaking countries 
and so forth. Space4k is being developed by GameForge AG.

Flaw:
=====
The login.php has a GET variable named "error" which is used to display 
a string to the user in case of an error, e.g. "Username wrong.". This 
variable is being send to the user without proper sanitizing. A 
malicious user is able to include arbitrary HTML/Javascript by using 
this variable.
