Cactushop (V6) allows remote users to download the database which contains creditcard
numbers and critical information. The affected carts default installation gives away the path to database file. As a result, an attacker exploiting this vulnerability will be able to obtain detailed private customer information, including credit card numbers, order details, addresses, telephone numbers, etc.
