Hello everyone,

After trying to report bugs to FuseTalk, and seeing them providing patches to
customers (dropping new fixed .cfm files in a private place reserved to
customers) without giving proper credits and without reporting them publicly
(we were following the Full Disclosure Policy v2.0), we decided to release
the advisories. It's a kinda weird attitude from a company that sold its
product to the NASA, Bloomberg, Adobe, AMD, etc. Here is the first one:
------------------------
Advisory: FuseTalk affected by a SQL Injection
Product: FuseTalk Basic/Standard/Enterprise ColdFusion version
Version: unknown, it seems the vendor fixed the bug silently in latest version
Risk: Medium

Impact: data manipulation

With an easy-to-use, intuitive administration system, extensive customization
capabilities and a rich feature set, FuseTalk is a pleasure to use for both

leads to data manipulation.
