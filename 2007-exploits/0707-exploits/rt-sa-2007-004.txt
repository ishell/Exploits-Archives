Advisory: ActiveWeb Contentserver CMS SQL Injection Management Interface 

RedTeam Pentesting discovered an SQL Injection in the
picture_real_edit.asp script of the activeWeb contentserver CMS during a
penetration test. An editor with the permission to edit pictures can
exploit this by injecting arbitrary commands into the "id" variable used
to fetch an image from the database.


Details
=======

Product: activeWeb contentserver
Affected Versions: <= 5.6.2929
Fixed Versions: 5.6.2964
Vulnerability Type: SQL-Injection
Security-Risk: high
Vendor-URL: http://www.active-web.de/aw/home/Produkte/~gf/contentserver/
Vendor-Status: informed, fixed version released
Advisory-URL: http://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2007-004.php
Advisory-Status: public
CVE: CVE-2007-3013
CVE-URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3013


Introduction
============

contentserver is the comprehensive, scalable Content Management System
for professional requirements. It combines editorial system, website
management and development platform for web applications in one package.

(translation of the description on the vendor's homepage)


More Details
============

By accessing the URL

https://www.example.com/admin/picture/picture_real_edit.asp?id=

an editor can edit images. The images are stored in the SQL database and
referenced by the variable "id". This variable is not filtered, which
leads to an SQL Injection. The query which is executed is

SELECT Bezeichnung,ImageKommentar,KatalogID FROM RealobjectSmall WHERE
ID = '$id'

By injecting commands into the "id" parameter, arbitrary SQL statements
can be executed. The structure of the query is shown on an error page if
there is an error in it (e.g., by setting id to a single tick "'"),
making it easy for an attacker to check the exact syntax he needs to
exploit the vulnerability. The return values of the query will be shown
in the form fields of the page.


Proof of Concept
================

The following request shows the version of the SQL server and the
operating system in the "Bezeichnung" form field, using an SQL UNION:

https://www.example.com/admin/picture/picture_real_edit.asp
 ?id='%20union%20select%20@@version%20,@@microsoftversion,@@version-- 


Workaround
==========

A possible workaround would be to use a filtering application set up in
front of the real webserver, mitigating the risk of being exploited.


Fix
===

The vulnerability is fixed in release 5.6.2964.


Security Risk
=============

The risk of this vulnerability is high. Any editor with the permissions
to edit an image can inject SQL Code, completely compromising the
database.
