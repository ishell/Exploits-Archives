Description:


AsteriDex is a digital rolodex for Asterisk / Trixbox PBXs. There is a
command injection vulnerability which allows unauthenticated users to 
execute arbitrary commands on the Asterisk management console. Such
access permits execution of arbitrary operating system commands as the
'asterisk' user.

The software is vulnerable in its default configuration.


_______________________________________________________________________________

Details:


The script 'callboth.php' is used by AsteriDex to bridge a VOIP call
between two end-points. Insufficient parameter checking is done on the
variables IN and OUT, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary
commands into the Asterisk management console. 

The script works by logging into the console server on port 5038/TCP 
on localhost. It then issues an 'Action: Originate' command which is 
used to setup the bridged call. The relevant code from callboth.php is:

  fputs ($fp, "Action: login\r\n");
  fputs ($fp, "Username: phpagi\r\n");
  fputs ($fp, "Secret: phpagi\r\n");
  fputs ($fp, "Events: off\r\n\r\n");
  sleep(1) ;
  fputs ($fp, "Action: Originate\r\n");
  fputs ($fp, "Channel: $IN\r\n");              << Command injection
  fputs ($fp, "Context: custom-callboth\r\n");
  fputs ($fp, "Exten: $OUT\r\n");               << Command injection
  fputs ($fp, "Priority: 1\r\n\r\n");

$IN is set from $_GET['IN'] with no sanity checking other than a test of
string length; all strings passed to $IN must be less than 100 chars,
including the string 'sip/' which is prepended to $IN prior to the length
check.

Given sane values of $IN=123, $out=321 and $CallerID=567, the session would
look like this:

  Action: login
  Username: phpagi
  Secret: phpagi
  Events: off
  
  Action: Originate
  Channel: 123
  Context: custom-callboth
  Exten: 321
  Priority: 1
  
By including CRLF characters in $IN, an attacker can inject arbitrary 
commands into the data stream, hijacking the authenticated session to run
commands of the attackers choice. Take, for example, a $IN string containing:

190@example.com\r\nApplication: System\r\nData: echo pwn3d > /tmp/hoku.txt\r\n
  
This would transform the session into:

  Action: login
  Username: phpagi
  Secret: phpagi
  Events: off
  
  Action: Originate
  Channel: 190@example.com
  Application: System
  Data: echo pwn3d > /tmp/hoku.txt
  
  Context: custom-callboth
  Exten: 321
  Priority: 1

This would use the call manager's 'System' functionality to execute user-
supplied operating system commands, in this case writing the word "pwn3d" to a
file called "/tmp/hoku.txt". The rest of the session would fail because the 
attacker has subverted the original 'Action', rendering the remaining commands 
meaningless to the manager.

Exploit:


A proof of concept is provided. It downloads PHPshell, installs it into the root 
of the vulnerable Asterisk server's web directory and sets a username/password of
trixbox/trixbox. It obeys the 100 char max restriction.
