 [HSC] PHPSysInfo Index.php Cross Site Scripting


PhpSysInfo is a PHP script that displays information about the host being accessed.
An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code execute
in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.
This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and
launch other attacks. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise
the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the
underlying database implementation.
