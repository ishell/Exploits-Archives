SiteScape forum prior 7.3 Cross Site Scripting

scip AG Vulnerability ID 3159 (07/13/2007)
http://www.scip.ch/cgi-bin/smss/showadvf.pl?id=3159

I. INTRODUCTION

SiteScape forum is a commercial web forum. It uses presence to connect 
teams through phone, IM, chat, SMS and email, as well as voice- and 
web-conferencing. The application also supports online threaded 
discussions and creation of content through blogs, wikis and 
workflow-driven document and task management.

More information is available at the official web site at the following URL:

II. DESCRIPTION

Marc Ruef at scip AG found an input validation error within SiteScape 
Forum prior release 7.3.

Some scripts that are not protected by any authentication procedure can 
be used to run arbitrary script code within a cross site scripting attack.

Other parts of the application might be affected too.

III. EXPLOITATION

Classic script injection techniques and unexpected input data within a 
browser session can be used to exploit this vulnerabilities.

The simple approach to verify an insecure installation is within the 
login procedure. Use the following string as user name and a wrong 
passwort for the simple proof-of-concept[1]:

    <script>alert('scip');</script>

A plugin for our open-source exploiting framework "Attack Tool Kit" 
(ATK) will be published in the near future. [2]

IV. IMPACT

Because non-authenticated parts of the software are affected, these 
vulnerabilities are serious for every secure environment. 
Non-authenticated users might be able to exploit this flaw to gain 
elevated privileges (e.g. extracting sensitive cookie information or 
launch a buffer overflow attack against another web browser).

Because other parts of the application might be affected too - this 
could include some second order vulnerabilities - a severe attack 
scenario might be possible.

V. DETECTION

Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or 
intrusion detection system. Patterns for such a detection are available 
and easy to implement.

VI. SOLUTION

We have informed SiteScape on a very early stage. They told us that the 
problem was not announced within a public advisory. But it is already 
solved within the latest release of the discussed software. Therefore, 
an upgrade to SiteScape Forum 7.3 or newer will solve the issues.

VII. VENDOR RESPONSE

SiteScape has been informed a first time at 06/29/2007 via email at 
info-at-sitescape.com. A very kind reply by Chris Pressley came back 
some minutes later. Further discussion of the flaw (how to reproduce) 
and the co-ordination of a public advisory was made.
