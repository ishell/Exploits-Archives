Element CMS "s" parameter script insertion vulnerability
=========================================================================


Release Date:    14.7.2007
Severity:        Less critical
Impact:          Cross-site scripting (XSS)
Status:          Official patch not available (0-day)
Software:        Element CMS
Vendor:          http://www.element.si

Disclosed:       Edi Strosar (TeamIntell)


Description:
============

Element CMS, a full featured Slovenian content management 
system, is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability 
because the application fails to properly sanitize 
user-supplied input.

Input passed to the "s" parameter in default.asp is not 
properly sanitized before being used. This can be 
exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code in a 
user's browser session in context of an affected site.

The vulnerability is reported in all versions of Element 
CMS.


Proof of Concept:
=================

Solution:
=========

Vendor informed. Official patch not available.

Note: because of arrogant and unprofessional vendor's 
response TeamIntell decided to release the advisory.
