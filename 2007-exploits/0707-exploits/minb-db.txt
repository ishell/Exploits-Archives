Minb Is Not A Blog default password directory

http://sourceforge.net/projects/minb

Via looking in a default directory, any user can access the users.db file which contains the username and encrypted password of the person running the board. 

Try it for your self:

www.example.com/minb/db/users.db

The fix right now would be to place the db folder out of the web directory or to make an index for the db directory telling others to piss off. Something as easy as <?php header("location: ../index.php"); ?> should suffice.
