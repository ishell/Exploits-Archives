The search form filed doesnt strip special characters that have special 

meanings. A single quote makes the application spit out a number of 

errors. 

This is not limited to the search query. The GET'd variables also fail to 

sanatize characters. 
Union selection:
www.example.com/index.php?mode=showbyID&jobid=99786'%20union%20all%20sele

ct%20something%20from%20something/*

Dump of entries:
www.example.com/index.php?mode=showbyID&jobid=99786'%20or%201=1/*

Using some old fasioned order by work, wee deduce 16 columns
www.example.com/index.php?mode=showbyID&jobid=99786'%20order%20by%2016/*

Thus, the fix currently would be to impletement addslashes functions to 

all areas that recieve (or can recieve) user supplied data.
