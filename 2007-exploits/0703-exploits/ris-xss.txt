Hi folks,

Description:

RIS is a public accessable web application to search/browse Austrian
laws, provided by the Government of Austria. It is vulnerable for XSS
via a malformed search query.

POC:

http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/taweb-cgi/taweb?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E&x=r&v=lroo&o=&db3=LROO

Legend:
q ... The search query.
x ... Must be "r" to perform a search.
v ... Must be "lroo" (other values not tested)
db3... Database to query on. Must be "lroo".

This issue has already been reported to the Government.

Regards,
Florian Stinglmayr
