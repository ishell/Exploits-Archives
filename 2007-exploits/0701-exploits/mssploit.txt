Advisory:
////////////
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 is prone to stack based memory corruption vulnerability
during processing .RC resource files, caused by the lack of input data boundary check.


Vulnerable software:
////////////////////
Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 SP6


Impact:
///////
Remote code execution


Attack vector:
//////////////
An attacker must construct malformed .RC file and induce victim to
open it either as a part of attacker provided Visual Studio project 
or as a standalone resource file component.


Technical Details:
//////////////////
The stack based buffer overflow occurs in Microsoft Visual C++
MSDEV.EXE process within the resource compiler RCDLL.DLL module 
while processing .rc resource files.
The problem lies in bad processing of the file name fields.
In the followinig example:

1 TYPELIB MOVEABLE PURE "FilePath01"

the FilePath01 string, if too long, will cause stack based overflow.
It is caused by the file name parsing procedure within the resource compiler
DLL, which checks for the validity of the file path.
It also excludes all characters codes below 20h, plus codes 22h and 2fh, thus 
the payload has to be limited by this ASCII pool.
The EIP overwrite value offset relative to the beginning of the payload 
(FilePath01 string) is not constant and depends from the OS enviroment.
For the Windows 2000 ENG SP4 it is equal 224 bytes counting from the beggining
of the FilePath01 string.
Also it should be mentioned that when the length of the string exceeds 259 bytes 
the resource compiler parsing procedure enters infinite loop,
writing the FilePath01 string repeatidly up to the top of the process stack memory area,
then continues entering the heap area and destroying the process heap structure
and finally causes writing access violation exception.


Solution:
/////////
There is a quick solution to avoid potential malicious attempts of 
this kind.
Before the resource compiler parsing procedure will cause the buffer overflow
through bad processing of the long file name string, it first monits user 
with the message box that the file specified within 
the .rc file does not exist.After either pressing OK or closing the message box 
the stack corruption will occur.However if the user clicks EDIT, resource compiler
will abort and the MSDEV.EXE process will continue without any exception.
Therefore any suspicious looking / unknown source project files matching
the above pattern may be verified that way, before the official vendor patch
is released.


Conclusion:
///////////
It must be considered that the attacks against the compilers are hard
to justify because it is often almost impossible for users to audit or even
understand every line of code in a project that they are ultimately going 
to compile and execute anyway.  
Therefore there is the same possibility for source code trojans and back doors
as for the file format buffer overflow driven attacks using malformed project files.
Finally, the most reasonable way to avoid this kind of attacks is to 
prevent from opening and running as well as compiling unknown source codes or
project files, including for example appended to this advisory Proof of Concept 
exploit (.cpp) source file, which actually looks more than suspiciously to me...  ;-)
