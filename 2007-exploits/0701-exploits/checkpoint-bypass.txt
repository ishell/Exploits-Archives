II. DESCRIPTION

One of the major things in Check Point Connectra is Comprehensive endpoint
security.
Before a client connects to the internal network a test is being done on the
client to check if there is any security hazard on his computer. If a hazard
is detected the user is prompted with the hazard details and asked to run
the test again before getting the ability to login to the network.

A bypass to this test has been detected by Roni Bachar and Nir Goldshlager.
A user with a security hazard or a Trojan can bypass the end point security
tests and login to the network with a security hazard on his computer.  The
bypass is being done by sending a "good" report to the /sre/params.php page
after sending the report a set cookie will be send from the server to the
client. This cookie can be used to bypass the endpoint security findings.

The bypass was detected on the latest version of checkpoint connectra R62.

III. EXPLOITATION

The vulnerability can be exploited by doing the following stages:

Sending a post request as followed:

POST https://serverip/sre/params.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: ICS_Secure 
Host: serverip
Content-Length: 251
Cache-Control: no-cache
Cookie: ICS_Test_Cookie=1

After sending the request a Set-Cookie will be received from the Check Point
Connectra server

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
